- Section B: `Q3-Q4` covers statistical inference and advanced visualization/storytelling.
- Section C: `Q5-Q6` covers SQL engineering, leakage, and big-data style architecture.
- Section D: `Q7-Q9` covers regression/classification, optimization, CV/regularization, SVM/KNN, tree ensembles.
- Section E: `Q10-Q11` covers dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning.
- Section F: `Q12-Q13` covers NN/CNN/RNN/NLP and LM/LLM-agent design.
- Section G: `Q14` covers ethics, fairness, deployment governance, and monitoring.
- Section H: `Capstone` integrates full-stack implementation and communication deliverables.
