"While leaning heavily on traditional J-horror conventions to deliver scares and suspense, Calling creates a captivating, dark atmosphere and manages to connect with gamers' psyches in a way that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a step in the right direction. There were too many innovations in Final Fantasy XIII and now the developers incorporated all the feedback from the community to improve the game and offer all the Final Fantasy fans a better gaming experience. This strategy worked – the gameplay is pretty cool, the atmosphere as well as the effects (graphics and sounds) are stunning and the well-known setting is a nice bonus for fans of FF XIII.",
"Ultimately, this is the type of title that will live in my handheld for months, like Honeycomb Beat and Planet Puzzle League before it – a simple, wildly addictive puzzler with great presentation and a boatload of content. It brings a nice twist to a classic game, looks great in 3D, and totally distracted me from the massive release field this October – not bad for a ""little port"" from Japan.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania combines 300 stages from Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe into a single, massive package of entertaining and occasionally sadistic ball-rolling action.",
"I was hoping that Mario Party 5 would be better than last year&#146;s effort. While certain aspects of the game are a move in the right direction, the overall game fails to please.",
"It’s undoubtedly a bold (if not brazen) attempt to entertain, and while Gamestyle found itself striving to collect every last item from the first title, it is hard to see the same happening with this one. Which leaves its technical achievements looking rather muted.",
"An original puzzle game that creatively plays with dimensions while telling a good story at the same time. The setting is original, the voice acting is excellent and the puzzles are creatively designed. The game only lasts for about two hours though and the controls feel a bit nervous for some reason. You'll regularly and unwillingly drop items often too which is frustrating and hampers the overall pacing of the game.",
"Diablo II: Resurrected is a product that appeals towards the longing of the community. It adds new functions that bring it up to speed with modern games, but at the same time, it still feels like an old-school title, which might alienate some people.",
"Anyone expecting a Zelda-esque level of role-playing or story, or Mario-level platforming will be disappointed by The Forbidden Arts, as will gamers looking forward to a lush, 3D world to explore. In fact, The Forbidden Arts is a platformer with light RPG elements, a skeletal story and an imperfect balance between its controls and its demands. Ultimately, The Forbidden Arts lacks ambition and enough imagination to help it stand out from a crowded, accomplished field.",
"Tough, expansive, and boasting a surprisingly mature narrative, Sine Mora EX is a remaster done right. Offering native 4K visuals – if you’ve got the right kit – tons of content and rock-solid gameplay, side-scrolling shooters simply don’t get much better than this.",
"While Power Pros 2008 offers an undeniably massive amount of modes and options, we could’ve easily waited until next spring for a truer, fuller follow-up. Veterans of last season’s title have pretty much played this game already, but it is a nice place to start if you’re new to the series.",
"Gamers are now faced with the prospect of realistically committing a generous chunk of change to a series over a period of time if they have any hope of experiencing the “complete story.” In our minds, the quality of SiN: Emergence in no way warrants a 20-dollar price tag.",
"Fuel Overdose is a clear take on a classic, old-school, top-down racer with weapons games that were much more common in the 90's. Its nostalgic approach is enriched with very neat ideas like the grappling hook or remote mines, but it's also visible in terms of production values. Despite its visual shortcomings, little bugs and imperfections, it's typically the kind of little indy game that could become a dear and memorable experience, if only it didn't lack a local multiplayer, or players in its online multiplayer.",
"Ratatouille offers some multiplayer modes around cooking, but if you’re looking to get dizzy with a friend, we suggest doing something fun, like blowing up balloons. And then you can throw a party...and celebrate not playing Ratatouille on the DS.",
"I thoroughly enjoyed questing through Elsweyr and while I wasn’t looking to start a new class, I am happy I made the Necromancer, as she is certainly the second most fun character to play for me. The class is a blast to heal and DPS on, and I can’t wait to get her into champion level. The addition of dragons was done perfectly, and brings a lot of fun to the game.",
"Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD is considerably better than some cheap remakes that offer only higher screen resolutions. The developers have put a lot of work into their game and skillfully adjusted it to fit with PCs and big consoles (although there are some issues). Is the ""small"" Assassin's Creed worth your time? Yes - for this price it's a really decent game, even though the story and music are really weak.",
"The best thing Activision could have done is discounted the price making Payback closer to a budget title. At the current price point, I can’t recommend Solider of Fortune: Payback for anything more than a rental.",
"It's dull to look at, and, due to a lapse back into the more tactical, strategic gameplay that categorizes all of Koei's other war games, it's also fairly dull to play. [Apr 2004, p.100]",
"Graphically, things haven't much improved from last time, but the 80+ new missions, more comprehensive ship designs, and added weapons make for a solid follow-up to a genre-busting first game.",
"Ovivo is a beautiful piece that melds art, exploration, and mystery in a unique platform–adventure title. The levels are engaging, the gameplay intuitive. Unfortunately, the lack of clear objectives, control customization, and the inability to save game progress limits the overall appeal.",
"Though Tiberium Wars fails to push the envelope like recent competitors ""Supreme Commander"" and ""Company of Heroes,"" it's nonetheless a solid title and brilliant homage to its series' heyday.",
"NBA 2K23 is one of the best games that has ever stepped onto a sports court. Its gameplay and technical fundamentals are without doubt, but the addition of historic modes to its roster is a better move than the one the Chicago Bulls made when they selected Michael Jordan with the third pick in the 1984 Draft.",
"Even if 2D Super Mario Bros can't be the avant-garde of the video gaming world in 2009 as it was twenty years ago, it's still fun and entertaining as no other. ""New SMB Wii"" isn't perfect as ""SMB 3"", it alternates pieces of pure genius with some stages a bit too manneristic, but overall it takes the 2d platform games where they hadn't been in the last ten years.",
"Doesn't save the series, but doesn't condemn it further. Great with a co-op buddy, or if you like the score attacks. Only passable as a solo, narrative-driven experience. [May 2015, p72]",
"This is the crappiest RPG that I have ever played in my life. We all know that the N64 is limited when it comes to RPGs, but it appears that THQ didn't even try to make a decent game.",
"Overall, this a deep and wonderful game packed full of exploration, juicy combat and a strong story - if you can follow all the lore it pumps out. Square Enix have done a great job again of delivering a unique Final Fantasy world, in this case revamped for the modern gamer from an old classic.",
People looking for a fast-paced RTS should give this one a pass. Those who are interested in something that is a little different and like facing near-impossible odds should give Soldiers a run.,
"Has a lot going for it, though it's not the best introduction to this stellar series, and it doesn't offer quite as much bang for the buck as it should to the existing fanbase. [Sept 2003, p.77]",
"Fun, quickfire game modes and solid multiplayer shooting help steer Concord through an asteroid field of scepticism and unhinged vitriol but the space odyssey doesn't end here. Like any live service, Concord's ongoing vitality and potential appeal to new fans will hinge on its post-launch support, content roadmap, and building on Firewalk's exciting foundation.",
"What if the ideas and the themes of Philip K. Dick’s novels become a videogame? The result might be Californium, a first person-adventure with a simple and extremely linear gameplay but with great storytelling and an inspired setting.",
"Though Homeworld2 may technically be a sequel, it too doesn't distance itself very far from the original, and in some ways feels like a mission pack itself. However, that doesn't stop it from being a completely addictive -- if sometimes incredibly difficult -- addition to the Homeworld universe.",
"Only big fans of the Dynasty Warriors franchise will find something worth playing (if only temporarily). If you have never touched a DW title before, there are a half-dozen predecessors to this one that deserve more of your attention.",
"The sound effects and voice acting (though B-rated in and of itself) add a level of immersion to the game that, without it, would have been an utter failure. Even with them, though, the game only becomes passable.",
"What really made Final Fantasy XIII-2 an enjoyable game was that Square Enix brought the fun back. They brought back some the inventiveness, creativity, humor and uniqueness that we sorely missed in Final Fantasy XIII. Maybe this game tries to do a bit too much, and it's probably too late to dig this story out of the hole that it's in, but it was made with a heaping dollop of that undeniable charm that we loved in the older series games, and that goes a long way towards making it enjoyable.",
"It's fun from the first moment on. Venetica offers a great introduction, a fascinating story, great quests and a very charming heroine. If you don't have the time for complex role playing games, but want something more than just an adventure game, then Venetica is for you.",
"With Microsoft's typically brilliant online implantation underpinning everything, alongside its determination to break technical boundaries Forza Motorsport is a quite staggering achievement for a first attempt and is a must have for any driving game fan.",
"The Sojourn is the equivalent of one of those big books of crosswords you can buy at the supermarket check-out. Its puzzles are well-constructed and provide a nice mental workout, but they’re all rather one-note, and the game’s world is dry as toast. If you’re a hardcore puzzle nerd, give The Sojourn a shot, but those expecting to be taken on a deeper journey may be disappointed.",
"A simplistic isometric hack n' slash game that plays like a blood soaked version of ""Gauntlet."" By no means a revolutionary game, just one that knows what players want. [Nov 2003, p.168]",
"The Definitive Edition has fulfilled its most important goals. It revives the first Age of Empires in a more beautiful way than in the memory of the most nostalgic - and removes enough of the legacy that I can enjoy today just as much as it used to. Above all, I can hardly wait to see what the developers will do with the Definitive Edition of the second part.",
"Outstanding. It's the only way to describe the first work of the Spanish workgroup Akaoni Studios. They wanted to create a shooter involved with the classical gameplay-style of the genre and they've done it. It's probably the most beautiful game on the WiiWare - it's a pity that its lifespan it's just a couple of hours. Add a few days if you play it with a friend, but without any online options, there's not much to do after completing the game with very character.",
"Best of all, Eternal Darkness doesn't treat the story as an excuse to kill monsters; you kill monsters as an excuse to advance a great storyline. There's plenty of shock and gore in ED, but it's not afraid to show off its brains either.",
"Where Knights and Bikes meets the pass-mark for a sufficient, story-focused adventure title, it unfortunately falters with its insistence on a gameplay front that’s ultimately lacking and too often reliant on a repeated formula. If you can look past its formulaic moments of enemy-routing and the dead air that are its A-to-B travel, the tale being told in Knights and Bikes is pleasant enough and one that’s sure to raise a smile or two.",
"Not everything needs to be ""Gears of War,"" there is room for good shooters with some original elements that fill the gaps in-between ""Super Smash Brothers"" and ""Grand Theft Auto,"" and that is where games like Dark Sector come in. The multiplayer isn’t good enough to keep you playing for long, but it is definitely worth a single play through.",
"Quarrel! is one of those games that comes from out of nowhere but instantly will keep you playing through a whole day without warning. It doesn´t matter if you compete against the AI or other players, Quarrel! turns out to be an intelligent and highly motivating challenge.",
"The new content is a mixed bag and doesn't really do enough to make this version worth your time. There are some cool features the Wi-Fi item trading, for example but ultimately, Hoshigami Remix plays like a port rather than an update. And with no quicksave option during battles, it doesn't lend itself to ""portable"" gaming where the ability to turn a game on and off quickly is a must.",
"Despite the amazing scope and intensity of the battles (during the Omaha Beach offensive I’ve burnt 750 German tanks and killed 17500 soldiers), there will come an inevitable moment when Officers becomes boring and turns into Blitzkrieg 2 on steroids.",
"Once upon a time, Dimps was known and respected for the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series, that introduced a revolution in fighting games. Since then, the studio has created bad games, up to the point where we wonder if the same team is still working in the studio. Saint Seiya : Brave Soldiers never reaches the seventh sense, stuck with a bad realisation and a gameplay that shows its limits after two hours. Bandaï Namco's Game gained in dynamism and is much more spectacular than the PS2 episodes, but still, as one of the last games of the PS3 we expected better. The fanboys will enjoy the 60 characters and the OST but that will be their only sweet spot.",
This is it. The final compilation of the enormous storytelling universe that is Kingdom Hearts. And it delivers. Especially in terms of filling some gaps in the early story while convincingly bridging games from Birth by Sleep up to Dream Drop Distance while preparing for Kingdom Hearts 3.,
"Pitfall snagged me like a trophy bass. The gameplay is simple enough for any gamer to pick up, yet challenging for even seasoned gamers. The storyline and dialogue keeps things light-hearted while keeping the focus on the game&#146;s addictive gameplay.",
"For all the promise Pixel Pi shows amid the early phases, Pulse sadly delves little further into evolving from out its basic foundation — new ideas introduced later on feeling out of place and poorly executed, it’s hard to see them as anything other than square pegs forcibly shunt into round holes.",
"It's quite possible that Champions: Return to Arms is the best hack and slash game ever created. Unfortunately it has been built atop the foundation of ""Champions of Norrath."" So much so that fans of that game may feel somewhat betrayed that Return to Arms is so similar.",
"Some significant technical issues manage to do little to hold back the charm and wit of Wattam. It's a game that's great fun for both kids and adults, with slapstick humor and a sweet message of understanding people, despite your differences, at its center. It's made with today's toxic climate in mind, boiling the world's issues into something that doesn't feel cloying, but instead feels positive and welcoming. That, to me, is an achievement.",
Bloodline Champions is a good alternative that attacks some of the shortcomings and common complaints among users of DotA-based games. However it seems that we have not a perfectly polished product at the technical level and this can lead to users discontent because everything will depend on the number of users wich receive the offer from Funcom.,
"Immortal: Unchained is a souls like third person shooter game developed and published by Toadman Interactive. The idea of a souls like with guns is amazing, but the way it is developed, it looks like a set of beautiful non-original ideas stuck together.",
"A short, sweet season of story let down by the choice of form. We respect the experimental interpolation, though perhaps they should’ve played this piece straight. [Issue#19, p.87]",
Dark Energy has proven that determination and commitment do actually pay off. Hydrophobia Prophecy is in fact a great game that deserves attention from both newcomers to the brand and gamers that might have already played the older versions of the game.,
"Sonic Colours is a beautiful and challenging game that both old Sonic-fans and newcomers will appreciate. The problems with Sonic and having freedom in three dimensions remain, but you'll soon forget those parts when you're flying through 2D-levels at full speed.",
"It does add some new campaigns and story and even a couple of new features, but I can't tell you that this expansion pack is a great deal for fans of the game or beginners due to its price and lack of new and substantial gameplay additions.",
The few folks with the patience needed to understand the game's design goals and unusual approach will find a game with a lot of depth and a truly offbeat adventure. Those who abhor repetition and like their quests spelled out for them should stay away.,
"Each of the game’s characters come with an interesting, yet heavy backstory attached that’ll pique your curiosity and inspire you to dig deeper. At times, the narrative can get lost in the chaos of trying not to get all four characters killed, but when it’s present, such as in items and clues, it’s gripping and will haunt you long after you’ve beaten the game.",
"Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink offers an enjoyable but short game in the hidden object and puzzle genre. The price might be a little ambitious for developers Artifax Mundi, but they have put together a well-made title. Sadly it offers little over other point and click puzzlers available today.",
"Make no mistake: Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate is still a very strong fighting game. The offline game modes are excellent, and the mode and roster additions are very welcome, especially since they don't seem to upset the balance of the game.",
"Depth is certainly a game with an interesting idea but developed in a rather rough manner, leaving more than a doubt not only on the production value but also on the idea of the asymmetric gameplay, which is apparently riding the wave of enthusiasm born with Evolve.",
"Time Crisis isn't exactly gaming's Hamlet, but Razing Storm is actually a lot more dumbed down than Time Crisis 4. Deadstorm Pirates is the third game and requires a big install. It's Time Crisis with pirates. Pirates armed with laser targeting fully-automatic flintlock pistols. We'll let that description hang [December 2010 p73]",
"That magic that those previously mentioned franchises is no doubt a little lost within Marvel Super Hero Squad, in what becomes quite a delight in the LEGO games, can result in some painful and uninspiring play for the older gamer here, as the humour and universe is just not on par with the previously mentioned franchises when combined with blocks of LEGO.",
"The best thing a puzzle game can do is make you feel smart; The Roottrees Are Dead made me feel like the second coming of Sherlock Holmes. Its exceptional mystery is bolstered by stimulating puzzle-solving, a satisfying ending, and a cozy nostalgia that makes it weirdly relaxing to mull over a cup of coffee. Don’t let this quirky search for answers pass you by.",
"The base gameplay is decent, although the inclusion of power-up attacks and platforming obstacles only serves to muddle the experience, making success feel more like a matter of blind luck than skill.",
"Boyfriend Dungeon is not only the weirdest game in the love simulation genre, but also the most mature. While the experience is linear and doesn’t provide any real challenge, the concept of spending the summer with a human partner who can transform into a weapon works. The unique atmosphere is worth a try regardless of your gender or sexuality.",
"Evotinction may stumble in how it delivers its narrative, but it’s more than able to make up for that in the gameplay department. While starting simple, Evotinction soon becomes a varied stealth sandbox that provides a throwback to stealth games of years gone by. It might never reach the heights of its bigger budget inspiration, but in a world where stealth games are somewhat rare, it’s simply nice to see developers wanting to provide a throwback for fans of the genre, something Evotinction does successfully with its varied hacking-based gameplay.",
"The Settlers: New Allies is the latest entry in a beloved and longstanding franchise, and carries an inherent advantage of starting with a greatly successful formula. However, there simply aren’t any exciting updates or formula explorations here. The buggy quality of the code at time of review and utterly flat narrative are salt in the wound, resulting in a game that does not boast a single positive reason to warrant a purchase.",
"Rainbow Skies is not only uninspired, it feels almost like a cheap nostalgia cash-in for JRPG enthusiasts. The characters are generally annoying and mostly one-dimensional, and the writing is quite poor and riddled with syntax issues. The explorative nature of the game is something that players might be drawn to, but that's not enough to carry the significantly weaker portions of the game. The combat system is sort of cute in its simplicity, but it's not unique enough to keep players invested throughout all the annoying little quirks that fill up the majority of Rainbow Skies",
"Dead Cells is a game of many influences. As a child of roguelikes, metroidvanias, and souls-like games, it mixture many elements in a surprisingly cohesive and entertaining way. Thanks to one of the most satisfying sidescrolling combats and extensive replayability, it is a game that every Switch owner should play and keep playing.",
"¡Ay, caramba! Forza Horizon 5 is maturing under the Mexican sun a recipe concocted by Playground Games that has already delighted millions of pilots. Like an antojito, Forza Horizon 5 can be enjoyed in a good mood with anyone, anytime. Rolling over everything that has already been technically done and taking advantage of the Xbox Series X springboard to stamp the skies, Microsoft's software climbs the volcano of fun and unleashes an exhilarating torrent to be experienced alone or with others. It’s the festival of the decade.",
"Many of the game's elements are dated, while others are just annoying and problematic. If you’re looking for a children’s game or you’re a die-hard fan of the Neopets, then you might find some enjoyment within this game. Otherwise, steer clear!",
"In trying to please everyone, American Nightmare takes a small step back from what made the original Alan Wake an original and enthralling experience, but is still well worth the price of admission for old and new fans alike.",
"Instead of coming of with different ideas for a new generation, Sochi 2014 opts for another round of motion control minigames and only adds a manic insistence on a revolving door of controller hardware. It's unfocused, uneven, and typically not much fun thanks to the transient nature of most of its content.",
"As the game progressed, I felt more and more attached to Artyom and how his journey through the Metro would finish, which is a testament to the narrative, and the world it resides in.",
"There were a few fun moments while playing this, particularly in the Capture the Flag mode. Unfortunately, the cosmic physics combined with the hit-and-miss controls ripped the huge potential out of its heart.",
"Aterdux Entertainment decided to make an interesting low fantasy mix of adventure, turn-based strategy combat and RPG elements. Legends of Eisenwald offers many hours of fun, enjoyment and, unfortunately, a myriad of shortcomings all packed together.",
"Fallen Legion isn't a home run. The story is somewhat trite and undercooked, and most of the cast are little more than stereotypes, but there's an earnest charm to the game that's hard to overlook, and the brevity of the campaign actually works in its favour. The frenetic combat is undoubtedly repetitive, but it's occasionally thrilling, and the choice system is well implemented and thought provoking. This won't change the mind of anybody who generally avoids action role-playing games, but for fans of the genre, there's enough here to warrant recommending Fallen Legion as a bite-size adventure to tackle between bigger games.",
"The visuals may not be stunning, and the audio won't put any surround sound system through its paces, but Xyanide still packs some nice punch, especially when playing with a friend.",
The new mechanics that the developer tried to add to the mix end up making everything much less fun than they might have seemed conceptually. Adding this with the historical parts of the game makes it feel like a lot of the player’s agency has been taken away.,
"I wish we could have seen a little more ingenuity in the title, but then again it is a DDR game, and I can't expect any drastic deviation from the formula. This title's biggest strength lies in its successful incorporation of the Disney material, and this makes it a title worth picking up for any Disney Channel fan with an interest in DDR or music games.",
"Provided you can overlook plenty of gaps in logic (not to mention hideous graphics and lousy voice acting), there’s something to be said for Jurassic World Evolution. It may not be the greatest amusement park sim or city builder the Switch has to offer, but it’s solid enough in its own right that it’s at least pretty fun time.",
"An interesting game that blends intelligently two types of well known games: one of territory conquest like Risk, and one in which we have to form words. It may result very addictive for some players, but those who are not native English speakers will find too much of a barrier.",
"I loved Alan Wake, but American Nightmare makes me more optimistic for its future and I'd really like to see Remedy pursue future installments on a smaller, episodic scale like this.",
"If you think that 5th Cell was a company with only one great idea (Drawn to Life), you’re wrong. Lock’s Quest is deep, funny, intelligent, complex, and is full of details that make the game awesome and highly recommendable. Its most important feature is the mix of two genres, RPG and strategy, in a way never seen before in a portable game. Also, the game is very funny and has a nice storyline, so don’t doubt: get it.",
"Boyfriend Dungeon‘s unlikely mix of dating sim and dungeon crawler charms more than it irks, letting you romance your way through many a dungeon. Is it over too quickly? Yes, but this heartfelt summer vacation is fun while it lasts.",
"Look beyond the tattered edges, though, and there's enough to ensure that the monopoly on two-wheel racing Milestone now enjoys doesn't mean this wins out by default. MotoGP 13's a lean, scrappy racer that's not just the best motorbike game around at the moment - it's one of the best pure motorsport experiences on console for years.",
"This third game in the snowboarding series features a complete overhaul, dropping the whole race-circuit idea and taking a more open-ended, Grand Theft Auto–like approach to snowboard competition. [Grade = A+]",
"If you're a mainstream gamer, we have no reason to recommend Telltale's Game of Throne as it's far from being the best game of the studio. On the other hand if you're a fanatic of R.R. Martin's books you won't regret your purchase as it's better than the HBO series.",
"Despite some repetition in the environments, the bigger arsenal of weapons, new enemies, easier-to-follow story, and the new Fight 'til Dawn mode make Alan Wake's American Nightmare a fantastic addition to anyone's arcade library.",
"The character system seems deep and appealing, but is really fairly limited and what is there is undermined by the lack of true freedom in the game. Combat is a dreadfully boring experience that takes place in real-time in an ill-realized 'ring of death'. As for the rest of the game, the less said the better.",
"Drakensang is a must buy for every fantasy and RPG fanatic. Don't except a revolution or a GOTY, but except a game that has charisma and can be picked up very easily. There are some tiny flaws, but the moment that you venture into Avonturia, your troubles will be over.",
"The gameplay isn't as sharp though, with 'who cares?' combat scenes and the vine-swinging, platform-jumping action that is unforgiving to the slightest degree, slowing down the game even further.",
"The latest incarnation of the Namco Museum does a great job of replicating every game in it – it’s just a shame there aren’t more games included. What’s here is largely good, with games like Splatterhouse and the Rolling Thunder games getting a showcase that they haven’t had in quite some time. If you already have existing collections, then the regulars like Galaga, Pac-Man, and Dig Dug won’t sell you on it, but if you’re missing out on the lesser-seen games, this is a great way to get them at a solid price point.",
"Not the vastly different experience we might have expected, but no less welcome as a result. FFIII-2 comes recommended for those who didn't get enough from the last game - however, those who were unconvinced are going to remain just that. [Issue#214, p.74]",
"With a great story, cool time-loop premise, interesting characters and exciting survival combat, I loved every minute I was trapped in Alan Wake's American Nightmare and look forward to more of this style of episodic content, and hopefully a full-fledged sequel sometime soon.",
"The black humor, bad jokes and buckets of blood flying at a rapid fire pace in interactive form will keep fans of the series coming back for more while we're waiting for Hollywood to get its act together.",
"Difficult to be enthusiastic about this new compilation of Namco's games, because there are two problems. First of all, the selling price is too high and the choice of the games are not very interesting. Forget about it and save your money.",
"It's easy to see why this game never made it over to the states in the first place. It's nowhere near as much fun as the previous games in the series, and it's hampered by bad level design and boring gameplay.",
"As one of the better and more charming rhythm action games to come out in recent years, Persona 4: Dancing All Night is not only an apt and engrossing spin-off, but it’s an effective side story that will help pass the time while we impatiently wait for Persona 5.",
"The kind of game that needed a lot more work before it was released. While it's great to play as football legends, the roster creation system is incredibly restrictive, and it's impossible to field the kind of team of which you've always dreamed.",
"Calling has all of the technical chops to become a decent horror game. The sounds and graphics are fine, while the controls aren't all that cumbersome. Unfortunately, the story just isn't scary so the game feels like it drags on. If you can't stand to miss any horror game release, then your best bet would be to rent this title.",
"South of Midnight has a good story, and is a good action adventure game. It may get a little repetitive at times, but the story keeps you in enough to keep playing. I gave it all the time I could, and maybe it deserves another playthrough, since I walked away asking more questions then I started with. I only need to hear the music once though, I guarantee.",
"The latest title in the NFS franchise came back with fresh visuals. While driving on the road without any concerns and making to the top of street racing are always fun, even the lowest 'relaxing' difficulty seems not so relaxing for those who trying to enter the franchise for the first time.",
"I wanted to know more about the game’s league, but this title doesn’t deliver. With no franchise mode, Crib, or many amenities apart from nice stadiums, it’s the lack of connection with the league itself, not the fact that the NFL is missing, that is a letdown. Bolster this aspect and make some gameplay tweaks, and All-Pro Football will threaten Madden’s NFL more than the XFL ever did.",
"It's not a bad game, but casual gamers, and possibly hardcore-traditional-football fans, may get bored of pulling tricks rather than pulling skilled corners back on the real pitch.",
"Endless Space 2 really pushed the boat out with great animations and pretty decent graphical elements, but the constant performance issues do detract from the overall experience. I would recommend you check out a few gameplay videos before jumping in unless you’re a 4X fan. The game takes a lot from titles like Stellaris when it comes to politics, but stops short of being a great overall strategy game. If Amplitude pushed the envelope a bit further with a more nuanced political spectrum and ditched the turn-based aspect, I could have seen myself loving this game. But at the moment, it's just adequate.",
"It absolutely trumps the first game, which in itself was a work of masterful art, and leaves me hoping we don't have to wait two years for the inevitable third game. One of the year's best releases by far.",
"Capcom have produced a competent racer, one with a good range of option twiddling, that's accessible to all levels of skill. However, there's nothing here that hasn't been seen before, and there are no surprises waiting to be discovered.",
There is the skeleton of a good game in here: a multiplayer-focused Smash Bros clone starring Cartoon Network characters. But it's just too buried under poor controls and a mediocre single player campaign to achieve fun status.,
"Hardcore fans will get it for the new characters alone. But if you've ever been interested in DOA, and might be intimidated by its unique fighting mechanics, Ultimate offers a great platform to take the leap.",
"Wattam is not a great video game by any definition. However, it is a great, zero-stress experience that wants to show how great friendship can be. If you’re looking for a game to test your skills or provide you with a mature narrative that makes you think, Wattam ain’t it. However, if you’re having a bad day and just want to unwind by kabooming golden poops all over your screen, Wattam is more than happy to take you under its bowler.",
"The biggest draw is the Nerf gun that comes packaged with it, but surely you can find a nice Nerf gun for the $60 that this game is going to cost you. I'd advise parents and gamers to avoid this one, as you could spend your money on far better Nerf products than this amalgamation.",
"We can't turn a blind eye to the sporadically unfair AI, but that is also the only genuinely bad thing we have to say about Forza Horizon 5, a phenomenal racing game that excels on almost every front which makes this one of the best race games to date. This is a must have: a love letter to racing and pure, unadulterated fun.",
"While not a true sequel, Alan Wake's American Nightmare does a fine job of expanding on the franchise's universe. It may not have the depth of exposition of the original game, but for 1,200 Microsoft points ($15), there's enough here to please fans and newcomers alike.",
"It’s got a solid storyline and plenty of racy language (although not quite on the level of “Deadwood”), and while the action isn’t groundbreaking, it’s enjoyable. That said, there are a number of places where the game just doesn’t deliver the goods, and we can’t help feeling like this could have just as easily been a last-gen title.",
"Valkyria Revolution is constantly at odds with itself. It tries to be an action game, but at the behest of fans, more strategic elements were shoved in. You'll go into an action-packed warzone full of enemies to slice up, then you'll be rewarded with a seemingly endless amount of cutscenes lacking sound and fury and signifying nothing.",
"OutRun raises the bar for the series, with better visuals and more functionality than its disc-based predecessors. While OutRun may be more like “drag” racing than road racing for those who have experienced its cars and roads before, it’s easily worth the asking price to new fans of the series and to those who plan on exploring its multiplayer modes.",
"While the emphasis on the Batmobile late in the game can be incredibly tiring, the characters and world around you never stop propelling you forward. Combine that with the numerous upgrades for your weapons and plethora of side content available, and you have one hell of a Batman video game.",
"Valkyria Revolution is a noble effort at providing fans with a fresh take on the series but it unfortunately doesn't quite live up to its genre contemporaries. That being said, it may satisfy if you simply want to be immersed in an intriguing tale.",
"A fantastic choice for casual and hardcore baseball fans of all ages. It makes a great companion to the realism heavy baseball games on the market, and Success and MLB Life mode would both be worth the price of admission on their own.",
"The beauty is in the execution. They've elevated the experience with better production values and a more integrated story, a seemingly simple tweak that goes a long way in a genre plagued by repetition. [Oct 2003, p.69]",
"If you care about playing with Colts and Payton Manning, or you just have to have real teams and stadiums then Madden is your option. But if you want to play a good football game with the players of yesteryear then pick up All-Pro Football 2K8.",
"If you loved the original Life is Strange, We Are OFK should be on both your list of games to play and most definitely on your music playlist. It’s a banger, though it should be said, Debug deserves its own game.",
"Loop Hero is a fascinating roguelike that will excite fans of the genre and entice those burned out by it to come back and fall in love all over again. Its beautiful art style and addictive core loop will cause players to lose track of time, not realizing hours have passed between loops as they slay the day away. Loop Hero could use a few tweaks to make certain aspects more understandable, but in its current state, it is absolutely worth your time and money. Still unconvinced? Download the Loop Hero demo from the game's Steam page. Don't make me keep talking in circles -- be sure to check out Loop Hero as soon as possible.",
"A beautiful, fast-paced, fun game that can be recommended to all fans of role-playing games. It may not be the best RPG on Game Boy Advance, but it is certainly in the upper echelon of the genre.",
"Short but sweet, Alwa’s Legacy is a must for both retro fans and fans of quality, exciting Metroidvanias. The visuals tout some of the best pixel art on Switch and are joined with a killer soundtrack and sound design. With clever dungeons to explore and an intricate overworld to travel, Alwa’s Legacy will have players ensnared from the beginning to end. Having played Alwa’s Awakening adds some extra nuance to the adventure, but starting fresh with Alwa’s Legacy won’t leave players in a lurch, as it does plenty to solidify this as its own distinct game. Don’t sleep on this one; Elden Pixels has created a 2D platformer for the ages.",
"Loads of blood and body parts are flying around from the beginning until the end of the game. Despite the errors, the game looks very decent and plays fine. Before you know it, you're playing for hours and don't want to stop. This game is a must have for every action gamer!",
"Kick & Fennick is an entertaining game in its basis, although it can end up being monotonous because of its gameplay mechanics. The plot isn't entertaining until later on the game. Otherwise, it's a nice indie from a novice studio, even when it lacks something that makes you play again, apart from attaining 100% on every level.",
If you've always fancied the idea of having the genuine OutRun arcade cabinet experience with added online support then OutRun Online Arcade does exactly what it says on the tin while managing to be a lot of fun to boot.,
"If you play it for free this is an excellent introduction to the concept of Total War, but as a paid-for product it’s a sometimes awkward mix of fact and fiction, old problems and new.",
"The game is pretty simple to understand, and can even be a tiny bit exhilarating at first in dogfights, and relaxing in the exploration segments. Once that incredibly short space-shooter honeymoon phase wears off though, Manticore – Galaxy on Fire turns into a repetitive, unattractive slog to get through.",
"High Moon is really starting to find form and do the franchise justice. And despite the game's flaws, fans will surely find Fall Of Cybertron to be the best reflection of their beloved robots in disguise in many a year. Too bad they couldn't get Grimlock right, though.",
"Overall, Assassin’s Creed Liberation looks and feels like a cheap knock-off of the series, and almost every aspect feels like a dumbed-down version of what players have come to expect from the series.",
"Overall, it's a chilled out game with personality and charm, but there's not much more to it than that. While you may enjoy exploring the town and meeting its residents, there isn't enough substance here to keep things interesting.",
"I was a little bit skeptical of this game when I first started it, despite being published by Devolver, whom I know to have put out some excellent games recently. But Loop Hero delivers, both for retro and roguelike/lite gamers alike. It is clearly a lovingly crafted game that compromises on nothing. It offers creative story, game, and progression mechanics, and a wonderful overall aesthetic.",
"Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is a somewhat unique game. Especially thanks to its visual style, which gives it its own identity. The voice-acting is also very strong and the combat can be called interesting, but it stops there. Indeed, the elaboration of this is not good and the interface is a disaster. Then you have the poorly mixed-up music and the artefact based combat gameplay leans a little too much on luck, which starts to annoy pretty quickly. Bottom line: the concept is cool, the execution leaves much to be desired.",
"A Total War Saga: Troy, the third game in the series, is the best in all aspects, not only in terms of graphics and technical execution, but also in gameplay and the challenges we encounter during the campaign.",
"World of Final Fantasy Maxima features more options, minigames, bosses and soundtracks than the previous version. Even if the new features aren't such a great thing, the game is still largely enjoyable.",
"With already excellent weapon variety and intense combat, Splatoon 3 is a perfect fit for a roguelite game mode. Side Order’s outstanding new enemies and powerful set of abilities result in the craziest combat power trips Splatoon has ever seen. It does occasionally stumble when implementing its roguelite elements, leading to some repetitive boss fights and poor pacing. But even with those issues, this DLC is still a blast. Add in another stellar soundtrack and a distinct style that sets it apart from the rest of the series, and Side Order is a worthwhile stop at the Splatoon 3 buffet.",
"You shouldn&#146;t need double-jointed thumbs nor the kind of patience required to endure its faults. As it is, I can only recommend Mafia to those that for one reason or another cannot play the game on the PC. It isn&#146;t a bad game, it&#146;s just not all that it could be.",
"The simple controls and short bursts of gameplay make it perfect for handheld consumption, and a wireless multiplayer mode that allows up to eight other flipper-flappers to play with just one game card pushes its value rather high.",
"Ultimately, by neglecting to tell the stories about these games, Namco Museum on Switch leaves its selections in the unenviable position of selling their legacies to contemporary players on gameplay alone. Namco Museum would have prospective players believe that these selections are valuable, timeless experiences, but the reality is that no game is timeless — every one exists in its own moment, a photograph with its horizons safely tucked away in the background. For players that have the memories, maybe a faithful recreation is enough. But the rest? They’ll be left wondering what all the fuss was about.",
"Vergil’s downfall isn’t patently terrible, but just barely. It is, however, a pale shadow compared to Dante’s adventure in DmC. It’s three to four hours of gameplay that everyone who is not a Vergil fetishist can ignore and not feel like they missed anything.",
"Red 5 are gamers who were sick with the same ol’ shooter and the same ol’ MMO. So they went out and started making a game they’d want to play. Somewhere along the way, they got a little lost, but they’re back on track and with a thriving but small community they’re onto something very special. It’s a little rough around the edges right now, but I’d heartily recommend Firefall to anyone who’s sick of the same old MMO fodder. Just be prepared to roll with the work-in-progress nature of the game, and you might be pleasantly surprised at the fun on offer.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is the best way to experience a true classic. Many elements have been changed for the better, allowing for a smooth journey through and through. I found myself more entertained by the quest system and adored the set-up of the menus, and the mechanical tweaks make it a joy to play. Xenoblade Chronicles on Nintendo Switch is enjoyable for much longer, which made me fly through the adventure this time around. Sure, there were likely some expecting a grander visual overhaul, but that doesn't take away from the care put into the package. There is even an additional dozen-hour epilogue if you're in the mood for more Xenoblade. All in all, I am just happy that the game still grips me as much as before. Definitive Edition makes me remember why I love Shulk, his world, and all the wonders that come along for the ride.",
"Without a focus on MJ’s career, 2K23 doesn’t offer too much more than last year’s iteration. It’s a serviceable experience for newcomers and pros alike, it’s just a damn shame it’s becoming more and more a marketing tool than a game. What concerns me is, where do they go from here?",
"It is an exercise in immense frustration and painful tedium. When it works, and this feels a stupid sentence at this point, it does manifest the correct semiotic indicators of first-person shooting. You are mowing down literally hundreds of baddies with big metal guns. But that's it. And it isn't all that much.",
"Crappy graphics, but surprisingly enough it's a hardcore simulator game of the world fastest motorbikes. This title will definitely please those steering handlebars fans. The rest of gaming population will most likely get frightened by the game's requirements. [Issue#232]",
"Nintendo has good effort to make a multiplayer platform game here, but it just doesn't feel quite right, it's not bad but if you think of it as nothing more than a tacked on extra to a single player game then that's about right. But as a traditional 2D platform game it's the business.",
"I honestly had some doubts, as ""one mountain"" sounds a little shallow or limiting – but it wound up working out fantastically - ironically offering the most variety of the trilogy.",
"Those without boiling Guardian Heroes nostalgia are probably going to wonder what makes it any better than Castle Crashers, another celebrated downloadable beat-'em-up that was greatly inspired by Treasure's classic brawler. They have their little similarities, but is there anything that makes one less worthy over the other? Not at all -- GH still has that extra complexity in the fighting and the RPG-like leveling system.",
"The game utterly fails to capture the majesty and mystery of the Dune universe, turning it into an interactive Saturday morning cartoon--and a bad one at that. Toss this one to the worms.",
"If you want to play a worthy successor to the long line of Metroidvania classics and are willing to experience rogue-like difficulty to get it, Dead Cells is an experience worth having over and over again.",
"Even worse, the game has an annoying glitch where missed shots in HORSE count as makes. We love the effort Destineer put into the Paradise Island environment, but that glitch is unacceptable.",
"Ghost Trick consists of an impressively well written story told in an amazing way, combined with entertaining puzzles that will give your brain a workout. Even though it could be a tad more challenging and lacks the rewarding feeling you get when figuring something out in the Ace Attorney games, this is still an experience you don't want to miss.",
"In many ways, it's a spiritual sibling to Far Cry 3's Blood Dragon expansion. Both are fuelled by a heady brew of nostalgia and adrenalin, and both have tongue so firmly implanted in cheek that it bursts out the other side. Where Blood Dragon built to a manic crescendo, however, after the first few hours SUDR3ARHEEXPA too easily turns into a fun but flawed grind for all but the most dedicated Capcom aficionado.",
"Namco Museum offers players eleven arcade greats in a nice new package on Switch. Getting to take these games on-the-go is a nice treat, but they're still the same old games that have been re-released quite often. Pac-Man Vs. does give you a cool addition though, and it's much easier to play this time around.",
"Along with the intergalactic action of the mission-based single-player game, Homeworld 2 supports online play for up to six gamers and includes tools to build custom ships and levels. [Sept 2003, p.33]",
"Doesn't offer enough of these diversions, subjecting the bulk of the adventuring to an endless procession of serpentine dungeons, where killing some entrenched boss figures counts as variety.",
"Despite the shallow graphics, the new Supreme Ruler is a solid and incredibly depth strategy game that will appeal to every fan. On the other hand the new players will be overwhelmed by its complexity due to the complete lack of a tutorial.",
"The truth here is this: the game should have been released two years ago as it was meant to. Hardcore comic fans might love the game, but for a casual gamer, it's an average offering in an already overcrowded genre.",
The DS finally has an RTS capable of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the system’s wide selection of great turn-based strategy games. Don’t let the cartoon vibe throw you—Robocalypse has enough strategy goodness to keep any genre fan happy.,
"With Definitive Editions of the later installments on the horizon, Age of Empires is once again poised to be overshadowed. If you have an overwhelming sense of nostalgia about the birth of the series, this does an excellent job of preserving it while making it considerably more palatable, but for a trip down memory lane, it sure is expensive.",
"There's a whole new story, working multiplayer, thousands of new items, new mini-games and sidequests, new classes to play, and the ability to play evil and good plot paths. On the other side of the coin is gameplay that most of us have seen before, following the same formula, and not taking any real chances in the process.",
From the start you can tell the puzzles are going to be good but even that will start to wear thin when you have to battle the same monsters time and time again whilst moving from room to room.,
"If you like adventures with a strong narrative load, and that deal with real themes, even with fantastic overtones, A Space for the Unbound has many chances to delight you. And it also has almost everything: graphics, sound, good design, characters, script... It may have some ups and downs in its development, but if you take the bait, you won't be able to put it down.",
"Spilled! is a calm and simple indie game. The rudimentary imagery and wholesome audio work particularly well. Furthermore, the gameplay is refined but fun. My only complaint is it isn't long enough.",
"There’s a lot to love in Nintendo’s second iteration of its quirky shooter, especially the way Splatoon 2 emphasizes splatting the ground just as much as it does inking your opponents. The new additions to its single-player campaign and multiplayer modes are a step in the right direction, but it still has some work to do to make joining online games and voice chat less of a hassle. Still, with an addicting new Salmon Run co-op mode and the promise of free updates like the ones that helped the original Splatoon come into its own, I expect Splatoon 2 to keep me hooked.",
"Starting as a good joke, Pikuniku quietly evolves into a nice little game with a crazy story. Simple and rather good in everything it has to offer, it’s in some ways a good avenue to introduce kids to the metroidvania genre.",
"When I find that my complaints largely have to do with wishing there was more content in a game that is already perfectly sufficient, I know that I’ve had a good time. It feels strange to call Pac-Man World a “classic,” but the numbers don’t lie. The original game sold 1.5 million units, was well-received by critics and justified a number of sequels. Bandai Namco is most justified in trying this on to see if there’s room to revive the Pac-Man World property with new games, and based on the quality of this, I’d like to see what a new Pac-Man World looks like down the track.",
"Rock Band 3 is simply perfect. It's the final evolution of the music games, the perfect harmony between game and study, the perfect party experience and an awesome game. Everything is packed with love and attention, from the smaller thing to major features. If you love music and videogames, buy it and love it.",
"From its action to its slick presentation, everything about Rollerdrome screams “effortlessly cool” from the moment it ramps off. Its breakneck pacing and unabating stages make each victory feel well earned, and revisiting each feels like a mastery that verges on transcendental.",
"There is a disappointing paucity of extras beyond the main endurance mode. Players of Lumines could face off against a friend or against a murderer's row of computer characters; Electronic Symphony ditches the ""versus CPU"" option.",
It is rather odd given all the overhauls done to these two games that Team Ninja didn't see fit to localize the voiceovers. Luckily there are English subtitles to help you understand what is going on pre and post fight.,
"Splatoon 2 could’ve done more to differentiate itself from its predecessor, but ultimately what we’re left with is an upgrade over the original in almost every way. Sure, returning players might be underwhelmed with the familiarity, but anyone jumping into Splatoon for the first time will be blown away. Another Switch essential, especially for those multiplayer fans – let’s just hope Nintendo’s smartphone app works as elegantly.",
"That’s the thing about Forza Horizon 5 - it’s like a Forza Horizon greatest hits album. The handling and fundamental mechanics remain unrivalled; the cars are still absolutely stunning; and as for Mexico as an environment… well, it’s honestly a bit mind-blowing – especially on new-gen consoles (although it works perfectly on the lower-end Xbox One S console, too). Ultimately, it’s hard to fault Forza Horizon 5 at all. Sure, it may not be brimming with exciting innovations, but it’s packed to the rafters with the entire franchise's most memorable, compelling content, informed by everything that Playground Games has learned over the last nine years. Forza Horizon is most definitely a jewel in Xbox's crown, and Forza Horizon 5 is quite possibly the shiniest of them all.",
"Despite its linearity, Ghost Trick still is going to provide you with anywhere between eight and ten hours of gameplay and story, each hour more compelling than the last as the mysteries unfold. Its a completely fresh experience on Nitnendo's handheld, or anywhere else for that matter, and certainly not one you'll want to skip.",
Trek to Yomi is presented like a very different type of video game experience and that's largely attributed to its presentation. Flying Wild Hog went into this project with the goal of making a playable samurai film and they've capably accomplished that objective.,
"FF XIII-2's reliance on recycling locations and reluctance to indicate the next course of action hold it back from scoring as highly as XIII, despite its improvements – but its grand ideas, bigger monsters, and bigger still haircuts make it an adventure worth getting lost in time for. Lightning can strike twice after all.",
"I just found Monaco hard to enjoy. I was either rushing to reach a checkpoint before guards killed me or I was roaming aimlessly, being booted back to the beginning of the level when I died too many times. Monaco very rarely hits that stealthy sweet spot - that sense of quietly and carefully infiltrating enemy territory, knowing that you're vastly outnumbered and you'll be killed if you screw up. Instead, it usually just tests your patience.",
"We're sorry to heap such bile on a game that we actually like at times, but it's a bit like hearing a bad cover version of a song that you've grown to like that some people still maintain is rubbish. Our advice? Buy the PC version of Mafia.",
"It's not entirely free from the monotonous grind that's so common to the genre, but the more repetitious moments are balanced by bursts of fun personality and outrageous antics that keep up the zippy pace. [Nov 2012, p.85]",
"This is the best Lego game so far, with TT Fusion pushing away from licensed franchise tomfoolery into completely new territory. Will we see more Chase McCain and other original ideas in the future? I hope so.",
"A great port from the console versions. All the original characters and modes are there. And with the ability to challenge other players online and offline, gives it an even greater replay value.",
"This year's edition solidifies its claim as the best football game around, but it also showcases a need for competition, so there is pressure to iron out some of the frustrating kinks.",
"Full Motion Video, the return of Joseph Kucan, the introduction of a third race to play, and the incredible competitive multiplayer package really shows just how much was spent to make this game the best production possible.",
"Maybe we expected something more after the Wii games and thanks to the use of Kinect. Some of the minigames are great, but we feel we had already seen others. Anyway, it is a fun game with a lot of content that will be enjoyed by everyone.",
"This is a tough but addictive installment for the third SUPERHOT follow-on. This game includes multi-level stages, a variety of new enemies, and a roguelike element that puts a fresh twist on the beloved original. Mind Control Delete is also free to those who already own SUPERHOT.",
"Ikachan is not a bad game, but there's very little to recommend it apart from its pedigree and connection to Cave Story. There's not much to explore, no real challenge, and no reason whatsoever to come back. It introduces concepts that depart almost immediately, and does not provide optional objectives, and its lone boss fight is criminally easy. It may be worth taking a dip, but don't expect much depth.",
"Virgil's Downfall will add another 8 or so hours of story to your Devil May Cry game, and for those who enjoyed the original game immensely the extra few dollars to purchase is a good investment to get a little more of the same experience. As long as you don't get your heart set on getting the exact same play that you loved about the original you'll be leaving happy.",
"Super Mutant Alien Assault has some good ideas in it, but the balance of quality vs quantity was shifted way too far towards the latter, resulting in a potentially excellent platformer that’s been ruined with unnecessary filler. Give this one a miss unless you’re a huge fan of getting really angry at video games.",
"The best game of the series of Sherlock Holmes with unexpected twists and an exciting plot. The game defines perfectly the personality of Holmes. An adventure full of exploration, puzzles and some touches of action.",
"Ultimately this version of OutRun isn’t the most complete, and doesn’t have a huge amount of depth. What it does do well, though, is boil down the most exiting parts of the racing genre and deliver arcade-style thrills to your living room.",
"Hunt the Night has good core mechanics and an interesting universe to explore. But this is the kind of experience that will cause frustration and players need to be ready to deal with that. A big time and energy investment are needed to master combat scenarios, especially when bosses are involved. Both the world and the presentation are good enough to keep players interested. There's also nothing better than finally winning a fight you've previously lost tens of times. Hunt the Night could have used a few extra concessions for newcomers but it's one of the best top-down combat-focused experiences for players who want to be challenged.",
"If you are a complete demented whack job, hey, this might be the game for you but for those looking for solid gameplay via both SP and MP, Soldier of Fortune: Payback is not worthy of a rent let alone a $60 purchase.",
"While most of the things displayed in Forge look pretty good, one can never take away the sensation that most of its features have been rushed and that we're all beta testing it. It could greatly use a few more weeks of extra work on the coding.",
"Original, quite fun and incredibly surprising. Shu Takumi's latest work's probably his best so far, although it's far from perfection. Buy it and you'll have tons of hours to have some fun dealing with the misterious death of Sissel, the ghost detective.",
"Everyone involved with its creation probably had a swell time putting it together, laughing about all the nods and winks they could cram in, its just a shame more of that exuberance didn't go towards refining the core of the game. The end result is that Hell Yeah is the gaming equivalent of a novelty tie.",
"If you haven't played any of the franchise games and are looking for a recent sim city game, this will keep you busy for a while. To the rest, Cities XL 2012 will probably feel more of an expansion (fully priced though), than a new, independent addition to your collection. [March 2012]",
"A fun, if brief game that manages to capture much of the appeal of the original, yet overcomplicates the core gameplay without enhancing it much. The game is entertaining while it lasts, but you won’t be digging it very long.",
"Samorost 3 is as frustrating as it is beautiful. It takes some interesting ideas, a gorgeous environment, and a fantastic soundscape and applies them to a gameplay formula that doesn't work quite as well as it should. And with its short playtime and weak motivation, there's not much reason to embark on a journey in this world.",
"The game successfuly builds on accomplishments of the series' earlier installments without becoming stale and outdated (thanks mostly to the awesome new play modes.) [Sept 2005, p.84]",
"Batman: Arkham Knight is a game that shows what can happen when a talented development studio is completely invested in a fictional universe and has mastered the technology to bring it to life. We’ve become the Batman before, but never quite like this.",
How to Train Your Dragon is definitely a step backwards for Activision in terms of licensed games. It doesn't have the same level of polish and dedication that the previous offerings brought to the table. Still I respect the fact that the developers did something totally out of the ordinary for this game instead of the run-of-the-mill platformer we are usually spoon-fed.,
The seven dollar entry fee nets you four tables that have plenty to offer portable Wizards-in-training. Most impressively was how many of the online features from its console brethren made the jump over.,
"This new edition of Mario & Sonic is not so different from the previous one, it doesn't take advantage of the Gamepad so much and the online mode is unexploited. The game is still fun to play in family at home though, but we would have expected much more from it.",
"South of Midnight is a game that, with certain successes and limitations, leaves an indelible mark thanks to its unique atmosphere, proving once again that video games can be powerful vehicles to explore both the shadows and the lights of folklore and human history.",
"Forza is a force to be reckoned with, out-maneuvering ""GT4"" in several respects, and beating out everything else in the sim department on Xbox, straight out. The fact is, Forza does some things better than ""GT4"" and some things worse, but it's a must-have game, full stop.",
"This is a good example of how to bring a movie to consoles. In terms of gameplay, it's quite solid. Visually, it fulfills with honor. Raven Software has proven it can bring Marvel licenses to a good end.",
"Dicefolk gets a lot right, and the developers clearly thought hard about how to take a fundamentally dice-based game, and make something that players could enjoy as a tactical roguelike, where randomness does not result in frustrating failures. However, Dicefolk is, ultimately, a pastiche with very little of its own creative identity, and I do think this is going to limit its audience to only the most hardcore Slay the Spire fans. But, then again, it’s not my job to worry about the commercial viability of a game. For those who simply cannot get enough of roguelikes, Dicefolk is yet another one for you to play.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is Electronic Arts’ best football game to date. The game has clearly progressed, and it’s now got to the stage where there is little room for improvement which could become an issue. That may seem like an odd criticism, but if EA wants to make additional improvements in next year's inevitable release, it’s going to have to pull something really special out of the hat. Something that even Lionel Messi would be proud of, but that’s a potential concern for another day. For now, the football action on the pitch doesn't get much better than EA Sports FC 25.",
"A Total War Saga: Troy is not a bad game, but some of the developers' decisions were quite controversial. However, it will always find its loyal fans thanks to unique setting. And it's possible that later it will be expanded and upgraded.",
"Despite the addition of NPCs and a load of new content, Fallout 76: Wastelanders is still just a painfully average Fallout game. That's not to say that things aren't better for the update, because the game at least feels like it's moving in the right direction, but it's building on top of the still rickety foundations of the original release. Ironically, things might be simpler if they simply nuked the game and started again, but you've got to respect the hussle.",
"It's not impossibly hard, but easily frustrated, weak sauce gamers may want to try before they buy. Still, Death Jr. has a great style, and the characters have a lot of personality, so even with its flaws, it's definitely worth playing. [Sept 2005, p.82]",
"Revengeance only falters in its overall length. There's plenty of replay value, of course, but this is one of the rare times when gameplay can't quite overcome the lack of a meaty core experience. Still, this is a game not to be missed, folks.",
"The gameplay isn't smart, the customizing RPG elements aren't very complex, and the story isn't presented with the kind of flair that Shirow Masamune's manga has inspired in film, on TV, or even in previous videogames.",
"Fiddling with a well-loved formula is frequently a recipe for disaster, but Might and Magic Heroes VI manages to maintain the feel of the series while making the franchise relevant for a new generation.",
"Subsequent episodes of The Walking Dead: Michonne were issued very quickly. This affected the quality of the final product, and the full story can be completed in few hours. The game fails in many ways and makes us more a spectator than a participant in the events.",
"Despite some disheartening bugs, Vermintide is much more than a mere Left 4 Dead clone: relentless action, endless waves of enemies and true co-op action makes it worthy of your time.",
"It only works as a whole, and it doesn't hit you like a flavour; it builds up in your system like an intravenous solution. If you took away the masks, or the blinking colours, or knocking over guys with doors, or the stuff about answerphone messages, or the DeLorean, or the wobble on the screen, or the super-fast movement, or walking back through what you've just done, you probably wouldn't understand why it stopped working, but it would definitely stop working.",
"With an emphasis on vehicular carnage and shattering buildings, Ridge Racer Unbounded rides high as long as you can find new thrills. However, the way it recycles elements from course to course quickly wears away the sense of discovery and makes it hard for user creations to truly stand apart.",
"Despite a solid core with improved physics, responsive controls, and immersive DualSense features, the game falls short with its limited game modes, average visuals, and lack of accessibility for newcomers.",
"BOXBOY! is a solid puzzle game with touches of platforming mixed in that puzzle game fans should check out. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel of the genre or leave a lasting impression, but it’s a fun way to tease your brain and enjoy some clever puzzle designs.",
"There are a lot of characters here, and the game covers quite a bit of narrative ground, but the presentation and combat engine are just so clumsy that it’s impossible to recommend Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers to anyone but the most desperate fans of the anime.",
"Diablo 2: Resurrected is, if anything, a faithful remaster of the original game. The visual overhaul and fantastic cinematics maintain the dark tone of Sanctuary’s horrifying demons and tales. Unfortunately, that alone doesn’t hold up after 20 years of innovation. Annoying gameplay mechanics, constant selling and buying, restrictive controls, regressive character art, and finicky UI poorly date this adventure. More quality of life changes should be here to truly bring the classic back to life. Diablo fans may love this remaster; others will likely not.",
"With a thoughtful message, soulful world, and beautifully imaginative design to push things along, Compulsion delivers a classic adventure seemingly beyond their weight class with South of Midnight. It’s the exact, elusive story-driven diamond in the rough that Xbox has been in search of for generations now.",
"Blade Kitten is simple, but simple is fun when such a fantastic world surrounds you. Kit's characterization makes immersing into Blade Kitten's world difficult, but at least attempt the adventure. You may not want to kill Kit the whole time. Maybe.",
"For fans of the original, This the Police 2 is undoubtedly a stronger game. For new players, if you want to understand some of the characters in this game you might want to pick up This Is The Police for the story, but in terms of gameplay, this is a far more polished, in-depth and immersive experience than This Is The Police. This Is The Police 2 comes recommended to anyone who wants a cop-themed game that has an engrossing narrative and fun gameplay hooks that is easy to get to grips with.",
"An average arcade game for relaxing after a long day that will entertain you for a while but in a few days, you will forget about it. The core of the game is fun, but after playing for a while you are facing stereotype and boredom.",
"The game is slow to entrust you with special moves (your only sign of character progression), and plot holes in an otherwise adventurous storyline keep the film reel in shoddy shape.",
"Elder Scrolls Online Elsweyr is the best expansion for the MMO yet. The new zone is beautiful, the Necromancer class is excellent and the story is engaging. Although the story does take some notes from other popular media.",
"The art design is unique, the story akin to one of Square Enix's RPG DS titles and it's a great game to play for short bursts of time, perhaps on a regular commute, because the battles themselves don't take too much time to complete.",
"As an abstract total conversion of Total War, Troy is a passable game, but it does very little to convey the atmosphere of Iliad (or that movie with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, for that matter).",
"One look at Close to the Sun and you’ll have a fairly clear picture of whether it’s for you or not. Despite its lofty ideas and immersive environments, Close to the Sun is a fairly lightweight adventure that trades on creeping scores and an intoxicating aura of mystery. There’s nothing to grapple onto that really elevates it above this. That's not to say this is an average game, it's a stronger experience than that, it just struggles to pull itself into the echelons of must-play territory. For horror fans, that could well be enough though, and it’s an engaging enough time but not one that necessarily sticks after the credits roll.",
"For Xbox owners, this version is especially enticing since the graphical bugs of NCAA Football 2005 are fixed. It's a bit disappointing, though, that the game feels like it's not living up to its potential.",
"In the wrong hands, Pikuniku could have been a shallow and ultimately forgettable experience, but its expressive dialogue, clever framing, and charming, upbeat soundtrack do enough heavy lifting to elevate it into something far more endearing. The characterization, in particular, is delightfully fleshed out. It's a simple game with a ton of heart that'll leave you beaming when everything's said and done.",
"What an awesome surprise - DD wasn't even on my radar, but it deftly mixes ""Road Rash's"" two-wheeled combat with ""SSX's"" long and crazy downhill drops to create one hell of a rush. [Aug 2003, p.121]",
"All in all, it seems like Activision has missed the boat. Instead of going the ""Prince of Persia"" route, taking a nostalgic title and darkening the action while beefing up the story, Lost Expedition wallows in mediocrity like a large, pink sow that uses words like mediocrity.",
"Extremely colorful and detailed, the environments and character models will make you think you're playing an Xbox game - and an excellent Xbox game at that. The environments are huge and imaginative.",
"It’s not for everyone. The action can be overtly simplified at times especially compared to earlier entries in the series. The game also struggles at times with its pacing, controls, and framerate. Still, I applaud Koei Tecmo for doing an impressive job in delivering a competent strategy gaming experience on the console.",
"Instantly accessible, free for the base game, an active community that's happy to accommodate new players and a combat system that's got plenty of room to grow, Funcom have whacked this one out of the park.",
"Persona 4: Dancing All Night proves yet another success in branching out to another genre for the folks at Atlus. If not for the relatively short list of songs and lack of multiplayer, this could’ve easily been the premier rhythm game on the Vita.",
"As a cycling game, Le Tour de France 2014 isn't all that bad. There are however far more interesting sports to turn into a videogame and this title suffers from that fact. Even at its best, a virtual tour remains a rather dull experience.",
"If Revengeance didn't have camera issues this would be the easiest 10 I've ever given. As things stand it's still brilliant, staking out new territory in the genre and adapting certain Metal Gear characteristics so well that it makes the competition look outrageously bad. This is simply the ultimate one-man show, worth its ticket price many times over, an experience that improves exponentially as it gets faster and as you get better.",
"The Portal add-on to Zen Pinball 2 is another excellent addition to the already-strong lineup of tables available, and having played most of the selections on offer, I'd say this one ranks right near the top. For anyone who loves Portal, pinball, or both, this is an absolute no-brainer.",
"EA SPORTS FC 25 introduces a tactical layer that alters how you play on the pitch. Combined with new PlayStyles, and improved HyperMotion, the game is an authentic representation of the sport. Although there are only small tweaks to systems, each thoughtful change improves your time under the floodlights. Rush injects new life into the multiplayer portion with its fast-paced, 5-a-side matches. While Career Mode still requires more attention, the new features are a step in the right direction. Although FC 25 doesn’t completely reinvent the formula, it successfully refines the gameplay experience, delivering a more immersive, strategic, and enjoyable football simulation that fans of the series will appreciate.",
"Blending roguelike elements with deck building and auto-battling feels like a combination that shouldn't work, but Loop Hero pulls it off in magnificent style. It might not be for everyone, but the core gameplay is entertaining, forces important decision making, and keeps players coming back for more.",
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos draws inspiration from some groundbreaking references when it comes to adventure games, and adds to them an extra level of challenge with a roguelite component. But while the simple gameplay, the world development possibilities and the co-op experience are indeed very welcome and well implemented, an overly simplistic plot, a lacklustre protagonist and redundant character development mechanics make this a game of limited appeal outside its narrowest target audience.",
"A must-own expansion for tycoon-style gamers, especially if you bought RCT3. It improves the original game enough that you will love the changes, without having to fight the whole new learning curve of the menus again.",
"Cleaning up a large house, painting the walls, and fixing the plumping is dull work for most people. For some bizarre reason, in House Flipper all that is fun. Being a sim title it's not for everyone of course, but those who enjoy the idea of buying, renovating, and reselling houses will actually get addicted with playing this, especially since its title that's incredibly easy to pick up and play. Sadly, it suffers a lot in terms of replay value. By the time you hit 10 hours or so, you've practically done everything twice, and all that's left is to simply experiment with new colours of paint, or different sets of furniture.",
A little game like Mario and Donkey: Minis on the Move would make a perfect test title for the broader mobile market. I’d be shocked if it didn’t rocket to the top of app sales charts.,
"Raiden can't block, he can only parry by swinging the left stick in the direction of an enemy and pressing square. That's right, one of the attack buttons. Raiden's motto is very simple: The best offense is a good defense. [March 2013, p.72]",
A must have for fans of the series. High Moon really gets the universe and you can tell there are some designers on that team that are hardcore fans. If you loved the last game this is a no-brainer.,
"Multiplayer is what’s really going to get the fans riled. After fine-tuning your ideal mech in single player, you can bring it online and face off against anywhere from one to seven opponents. Unfortunately, there’s not a whole lot of match variety outside of deathmatch and team deathmatch, and there’s no respawning so matches don’t last much longer than five minutes tops.",
"While its longevity may be tied into just how willing players are to shoot for the highest score and go after as many achievements as possible, High Hell is a wicked little shooter that you won’t soon be forgetting. Its eye-popping visual style will draw you in, but the rapid, skill-testing and just plain fun gameplay is what will hook you. Whether you blaze through things as if you were powered by inferno-style hot sauce or take your time to poke around every corner to find new areas full of demonic oddities to ogle, there’s still a lot here for you to enjoy, so make sure to give this sinful delight a shot.",
"It's full of charm and character, it’s fun to play and includes a wide range of gameplay styles, more importantly we can’t think of a single aspect that lets it down – truly ""Jak2"" is a perfect game.",
"The developers have outdone themselves once more and somehow managed to make an already fantastic MMO all the more awesome. The expansion whisks players away to the homeland of the Khajiit. Players must face the dragon threat looming over Elsweyr, though you do not possess the power some players may be used to if they played Skyrim. You are not the Dragonborn, and these dragons are no laughing matter.",
"Starwhal is meant to be enjoyed on the couch with three of your friends, with only one shared screen to worry about, simple controls that are easy to pick up, and fast, frenetic gameplay that can be enjoyed over and over.",
"Action fans everywhere are going to adore it, but I recommend everyone play it. It’s big, brash, loud and full of ball-shrinkingly deadly scenarios and for that, we can forgive the predictability of the rest of it.",
"In the end, Yonder is undeniably a fantastic game to sit back and chill with. If you're looking forward to some exploration, collection, and light building and farming elements, then Yonder is definitely right up your alley. However! There should be a heavy emphasis on ""light"" in the sentence up above! This is not the next Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. No, this is a game with few puzzles, no combat, and filled to the brim with fetch quests and item collection. Yonder isn't without its charms, to be sure. But deep and engaging game play (and story) definitely isn't one of them.",
"This is a good expansion/patch to a good game. It fixes some bugs, adds some interesting features, and slips in lots of changes to quietly improve gameplay and balance. It's definitely worth $20 for “Fallen Enchantress” owners, and $40 for anybody looking for a good 4X fantasy TBS.",
"Ronin is not a stealth game. The self-confessed Gunpoint rip-off is a frantic, physics-defying, blood-spattering, minimalist tale of revenge. It culminates in a superb final level, offering two equally powerful endings. And while its length might leave you craving more murder-fun, it does offer a new game plus: go destroy your enemies all over again, in style.",
"If I'd come out of Dead Island with a burning desire for more Dead Island, Riptide would go down a lot easier, but since that original game started out strong and just got weaker as it wore on, playing through another 15 hours of almost exactly the same thing, when the first one already felt like more than enough, instead just becomes a tiresome exercise.",
"In the end, Resistance: Burning Skies Review is a good first person shooter title for the PS Vita that although won't win any awards for originality, it still provides the player with a fun game with decent controls.",
"You may have to work to unlock the bonus games and more difficult tracks, but there is something about this game that will compel you to do so, playing some of the levels over and over until you accomplish the deed to advance.",
"While she's traditionally been either a hostage or a benchwarmer in the Mario universe, here Peach takes center stage in a full-blown, original platformer that will be instantly addictive to fans of games like Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World. [Mar 2006, p.118]",
"A repetitive and flawed experience from start to finish, SWAT: Target Liberty is a disappointing tactical strategy shooter that just doesn’t quite have what it takes to be a fun game.",
"Now, if they could just manage decent graphics-the game slides dangerously close to PS1 territory at times-ditch the freakish characters, and pen a halfdecent tale to go with the gameplay, SaGa could finally become a series worth paying attention to.",
"Pac-Man World: Re-Pac might be a bit basic at times, but it nails the mechanics and delivers on the production. It feels like exactly the kind of thing I would have enjoyed as a kid — which basically means I also enjoy it now as a platforming-crazed adult. I’m glad Namco is looking to its classic catalog in this way, and I’m hoping it means we get more from them in this style. Pac-Man fever? I have it.",
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is an adventure that is recommended for those who are already captive audiences of the genre. There is nothing new here, and there shouldn't be any. It seems that the studio knows who its audience is and what they like, and chooses to invest the time in a good story, an excellent soundtrack and graphics that will simply carry them along properly and not continue.",
"Hellboy critically hits himself with his large hand, in one of the worst videogames of the lasts months. An interesting visuals can be taken down by a poor storyline, with the help of a poor and repetitive combat system. Even if you are a total fan of Hellboy, it´s better to stay away from this title if you want to continue loving the character. Big deception for the new title of the big boy.",
"While severely problematic areas are easily discerned, the game's major failing is an all-over blah factor, a mediocrity of inspiration recognizable both in the underachieving technical facets of the title and the limiting non-gravitas of the overarching license.",
"It's the sort of immersive, feel-good experience that gels well with a modern quarantined life. It begs to be lost in, and boasts a phenomenal story, memorable characters, and a beautiful world to explore. Not even the periodically clunky combat can get in the way of that.",
"Sure, it probably won't please any hardcore Pitfall! purists, but if you're just on the lookout for a solid platformer for a weekend rental, then Pitfall: The Lost Expedition is right up your alley.",
"The attempt to reinvigorate the thirty year old Yar's Revenge is only partially successful. The stylish animé-sauce and gorgeous environments that go past you can't hide the average execution of the game behind it. The largest challenge it offers comes from your impending struggles with the controls. Other than missing any sense of reward whatsoever, it just hasn't been worked out well.",
"For the love of gaming Koei, this is just another mediocre expansion pack for a game that played like a glorified expansion pack to yet more games which felt little more than expansion packs themselves.",
"Rocksteady knows what to do with Batman, and brings us another superb game. Batmobile's addition could have been better, as well as some moments with some of the Dark Knight's legendary foes. However, there's no other current-gen, open world action game as exciting as Batman: Arkham Knight.",
"An interesting choice if you long for a proper challenge, and you don't mind there's no feast to your eyes. However, if rogue genre says nothing to you, take a different road. [Issue#232]",
"Looking at the big picture, A Fisherman's Tale has an original and absorbing gameplay, as well as an interesting story, brilliantly narrated. However, the collisions bugs and the shortness of the main story spoils a little bit the experience.",
"While it’s clear there’s more drama bubbling below the surface, ready to burst out, Bloom & Rage is shaping up to be my favorite narrative adventure game since Life Is Strange: Before The Storm.",
"A brand-new game that combines simple beat-'em-up gameplay with the kind of run-and-jump action that has been done so often, and oftentimes much better, in numerous other side-scrolling games.",
"Jagged Alliance: Rage is yet another release that uses the Jagged Alliance name but fails to deliver. The turn-based gameplay and the survival elements are good enough, but in other areas there are tons of shortcomings that not only disappoints the old fans of the series but also fails to ward off competition from other turn-based titles available on the market.",
"Puzzle Bobble EveryBubble emphasizes cooperative multiplayer but that doesn’t detract from it as a solo experience. The variety of levels and mechanics make each stage feel like its own puzzle, and the unlockable EX stages offer a stout challenge for those so inclined. The amount of content within the story mode in particular and the way EveryBubble scales based on the number of players lead me to give it a hearty recommendation. It could use a few more options in VS mode and extras in the main menu, but overall this is a puzzler well worth busting a move to.",
"Reality Fighters isn't particularly rewarding and it's a bit shallow, though it's a novel release and a showpiece for the possibilities of integrating cameras into traditional forms of play.",
"It’s easy to dismiss EA Sports FC 25 as a glorified reskin of EA Sports FC 24 – and in many respects, it is – but the customarily small tweaks made to graphics and gameplay add up to a near-perfect sports game experience. This is total football.",
"Personally, as much as I have been impressed by Forza, I found it to be just a little too much. It's a fantastic game, but one best suited to those willing to invest some serious time into their racing games.",
The developers put a lot of effort in the classic fantasy world of Aventuria. It literally makes you wanna dive into it. Weak point: You have to play ten hours minimum to really understand what’s going on about your character and the story.,
"If you want a game, there are better music puzzlers out there with heaps more content, and if you’re looking for someplace to fire up your musical chops, there are actual music production tools that will serve you in better ways than Track Lab’s isolated creation mode.",
"Splatoon 2 recaptures every moment of enjoyment of the original while finding room to add even more. Whether it's the challenging single player or the revitalized multiplayer, Splatoon 2 does a phenomenal job at making itself more than a minor upgrade.",
"Batman: Arkham Knight is the best game in a great series. Rocksteady continues to polish and improve a great combat system, with graphics and animations that have never looked better. A gripping, dark and perfectly Batman story with loads of great villains and heroes.",
"More of the same is literally what Dead Island: Riptide has to offer. The original's strengths and weaknesses return unchanged but inside a wider open world that greatly increases exploration, quests and things to do. It's still very enjoyable, especially in multiplayer, but the original's sense of freshness is almost lost.",
"Those Who Remain is a morally shallow experience with a repetitive plot. A few decent puzzles can’t rescue this otherwise-flat experience, and I was glad to be done with it when the credits rolled.",
"It’s a great looking game. The look and feel is wonderful and moody, punctuated with flashes of red, such as a boy’s blowing scarf or a blooming flower found at the bottom of a well. And it’s great seeing games coming out of all corners of the world. But this only makes the experience all the more frustrating.",
"It was the mission objectives that put fear in my heart. Many are downright illogical to the point where I could only figure out what to do by screwing up over and over. [Oct 2003, p.142]",
"A Total War Saga: Troy plays it safe in some slightly disappointing ways, but brings enough new to the table that I would appreciate seeing its ideas make their way over to the next mainline Total War game.",
"Roki’s story is dark, but also manages to bring with it the right amount of heart. The setting is also top-notch and the puzzles are a lot of fun. There are some minor things that don’t work as good as they should, especially the quest system and the item management, but they don’t change the fact that Roki succeeds in what it does.",
"All up, Namco Museum on the Switch is a solid bunch of games – 11 really fun titles that will have something for everyone. A lot of care has gone into presenting the titles and giving you extra ways to play them. If you are chasing the high score or looking for something fun to play with friends you cannot go wrong with Namco Museum.",
"The graphics look great, the commentary is interesting and sounds natural, and, most importantly, the game features balanced offensive and defensive gameplay that does an excellent job of mimicking the nuances of the actual sport.",
"Undercover’s story is an incredibly entertaining homage to countless movies and television shows, and manages to feature a very strong cast of characters – no small feat considering the game has no major license associated with it.",
Greatly improved gameplay mechanics make it a long lasting gridiron enjoyment. Overall Madden NFL 10 is a step in the right direction for the series and well worth the upgrade from Madden 2009.,
"Despite that small problem, Gallop Racer 2006 is a small improvement from the last installment. With even more addicting betting, stat managing and racing, Gallop Racer 2006 improved for the better.",
"Less successful is the convoluted city design that forces you to spend considerable time in transit between levels. Put up with this annoyance - the missions are an addictive blast. [17 Oct 2003, p.L2T 20]",
"I think the biggest problem with Reality Fighters is that your fighter, especially with your superimposed face doesn't look right. That and the background environments look a little plain, even the augmented reality ones of your real environment. It just doesn't look right. Fortunately there is enough options as a fighting game to keep you investing some time into it but compared to the more professional fighters out there, I would definitely try before you buy.",
"Firefall has its problems. There’s no denying that, but after spending a little time with it, I found myself having a pretty decent time. Sure, it does feel wonky at times, but I couldn’t help but keep playing.",
"This game has everything for everyone whether you’re into those car-jacking ways, killing innocent pedestrians, or just enjoy humor and huge exploration. Either way, you can’t go wrong with this title.",
"If playing the demo intrigues you, you'll probably not have a bad time going through the rest of the game, as I did. Re-imagining something as simple as an Atari 2600 game makes it pretty easy to get creative, and the new Yar's Revenge is definitely creative, with a respectable level of quality in its art design. But while it has the looks, and is a decent clone of games like Panzer Dragoon, it needed a little more attention to be able to match them.",
"Rollerdrome is a solid action game that merges shooting and sports quite well. The blend creates loads of exciting moments that only seem to falter during boss fights. The number of levels and challenges feels just right. The concessions made for all skill levels is appreciated, and the presence of leaderboards and a bonus campaign ensures that there's plenty of incentive to keep people playing. Overall, Rollerdrome is a great title for those looking for something different.",
"Trek to Yomi is a very beautiful cinematographic work. It doesn't have to pale before the giants who inspired it. Its use of the camera and black and white grain allow it to present us with particularly sumptuous paintings. Add to that some eye-popping fight choreography and you've got a little nugget of artistic mastery. If a game was judged by this, Trek to Yomi would undoubtedly top the charts. But unfortunately, the game is, in comparison, too little pushed in terms of gameplay. Its superfluous choices and its repetitive fights prevent it from expressing his full potential. That said, it is still worth the detour and even more so if you are sensitive to this kind of video game work.",
"From its opening moment until its final scene plays, Life is Strange is a wonderful, beautiful, captivating, touching adventure built upon the undying friendship of two girls trying to find their place in the world.",
"Ronin is an interesting stealth game, with a clever gameplay that combines turn-based and real time. Too bad it suffers from a certain lack of precision and a feeling of repetition, but it's still a fun game.",
"The Last Story employs some bold mechanisms in an attempt to chart new territory. If not for a few undercooked components like the multiplayer, it would stand among the best on the Wii. Still, it's a strong RPG in its own right, excelling precisely where you'd expect such a game to. The Wii could have done much worse for a bookend to its storied history.",
While the interface between you and your squad has been simplified it streamlines the process and therefore requires less jumping out of the action to control your team and makes the game more accessible to new players.,
"While it could stand to be longer, if only to deliver more when it come to some of its more ambitious elements, Trek to Yomi is an amazing action game that makes terrific use of its cinematic presentation, using Kurosawa vibes to impact both the gameplay and visuals in clever ways.",
"While the unusually small levels keep the pacing of the game fairly brisk, you'll also find that it takes about two hours of casual playing time to finish the entire game. Unfortunately, the game has little to keep you interested once you've finished it the first time.",
"Where GTA used humor, masses of distractions, OTT violence, and a giant game world with a real sense of space and depth to mask the unimpressive visuals, Driver is the opposite, using an impressive physics engine and city to hide repetitive and languid gameplay that's becoming increasingly difficult to enthuse about.",
"In a sport that symbolizes the cutting edge of car technology and the pinnacle of racing, the F1 series' slow progress is a contradiction. I enjoy the racing itself, but that only counts for so much. It's getting to the point that I'd rather see how other series like Forza incorporate F1 cars rather than play this franchise – and that's a bad sign.",
"A few hours in, you'll likely find yourself scratching your head as seemingly impossible puzzles best you. This can naturally be frustrating, especially as you move so slowly, but you'll feel like a genius once everything clicks. Many stages have optional bonus challenges once you solve them, earning you collectable scrolls complete with philosophical mumbo-jumbo. The main story is more interesting, told wordlessly through a series of dioramas, but it's the puzzles themselves that will keep you playing. It's not exactly original, but The Sojourn is a solid puzzler with well designed levels and some nice ideas.",
"Destiny mode is probably the most worthwhile aspect of Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends, so if it doesn't interest you all that much and you already own the original DW5 then there's really no reason for you to purchase the XL version.",
Forza Horizon 5 features all the content from the previous game and bumps the fun of this Horizon title. The game looks stunning and the gameplay is the same casual fun of Forza Horizon. The replayability of this game makes it outstanding and deserving of a perfect score.,
"The idea of Remedy using the time loop concept as a key narrative tool sounds great, but actually it does not work as well in a videogame as it did in films like Groundhog Day or Donnie Darko.",
"As a long-standing TDE-Fan I am literally overjoyed to delve once more into the fantastical world of Aventuria – and if it’s this well made, all the better! Though of course there’s the usual parade of odds and ends to criticize, like the missing character customization, but they’re all barely affecting the myriad ways to have fun with this title. To me, TDE:Drakensang is without a doubt the greatest RPG of German origin – Gothic 3, watch out! [Issue#15]",
"Unlike any other 3D fighters on the market. Midway has done an exceptional job of creating a brand new MK experience while still maintaining the old-school flavor that so many of us are familiar with. [Jan 2003, p.70]",
"A refreshing blast from the past, Tiberium Wars crushes any concerns surrounding the closure of Westwood Studios, with a surprisingly faithful addition to the series. Fast-paced, action-orientated, gameplay with a strong storyline and presentation, still provides the same sense of engaging gameplay and immersion as its predecessors.",
"Overall, this leaves After Us as a flawed but intriguing 3D platformer. Its moments of brilliance are great to behold, such as its varied, dreadful locales and those moments where its platforming truly clicks. However, its lack of character and story development and its more frustrating sections do mean that it's not a perfect game - but at the very least its heart is in the right place.",
"Pixel Piracy is a side-scrolling 2D simulator with RPG elements, where the player can recruit a crew, customize the ship and use aggression to find treasures. Even though the game is too linear, with poor combat system and unvaried exploration.",
"For all its many faults, the script does at least make a valiant effort of recognising and explaining the politics of war and propaganda. That doesn’t change the fact that there’s an army of games more worthy of your money. [October 2017, p75]",
"It's just so frickin' wild and cool. You can get whole forests to come to life and attack your enemies, build huge monsters like the Hydra (yes, it grows more heads as it takes damage), and pound the enemy city into a crater with meteor storms.",
"The Great Escape game had a hard time recreating what made the movie so great. Although my guess is not many gamers are going to be familiar with the movie, it should have been a better representation. Which I think would have made the game more enjoyable.",
"Stronghold Crusader 2 goes back to the roots of the series, taking us almost 15 years back in time. This can be good news for someone, but we expected something more and for the rebirth of the franchise we’ll have to wait for the next episode, hoping for a braver approach.",
"While the game sorely lacks a decent story to match its competitors, METRICO+ is still a decent puzzle platformer at its core. Fans of Braid will feel at home with its complexity and innovation, often requiring a similar level of spatial awareness and movement conservation to get through a stage. It manages to balance on the fine line between being too simple and too difficult, only occasionally driving players to frustration due to a lack of contextual instructions.",
"Neopets: The Darkest Faerie’s standout flaw is that it isn’t very exciting. It should’ve been with its Zelda-inspired combat, massive worlds, lots of scavenger hunting, etc., among other interesting and highly promising features.",
"The almost endless number of weapon, item and location combinations created by its randomly generated environments means you’ll never quite know what lies ahead, while the quest-led action and multiplayer functionality - particularly online - are compelling enough to keep you hooked for hours. [Apr 2005, p.108]",
"Is Turok 2 better than Dinosaur Hunter? I don’t know if I’d call it better, but it’s certainly different. Personally, I prefer the original game but I appreciate how different this sequel is, even if I’m not a huge fan of every single point of divergence. Certainly, the level design leaves something to be desired, and while Turok wields a healthy armament by game’s end, there’s a cruel practicality to virtually every weapon. The Cerebral Bore is great, but it’s a one-enemy gun. Dinosaur Hunter had the Particle Accelerator and Fusion Cannon, both of which wiped out entire landscapes of enemies. This may be a consideration for Turok 2’s more closed, corridor-heavy environments, which is another thing I don’t love about it. However, the enemy designs and overall uniqueness of the environments really is special.",
"Vampire :The Masquerade: Bloodhunt is a solid battle royale with huge potential that it’s not quite reaching just yet. The traversal and rooftop battles are huge fun and the map is terrific. So long as Sharkmob believe in it, there could be something pretty special here down the line.",
"I suspect I’m going to continue thinking about The Thaumaturge for a long time. The game is easy to pick up and very difficult to put down. While it might look like a very specific CRPG for a very specific type of audience, I feel like the way it combines its setting, storytelling, and mechanics makes for an extremely compelling game and a strong contender for those looking to get into CRPGs.",
"Overall, the game is definitely worth the price and will provide some good entertainment. Hardcore RTS fans won't find the game to be very good unless they look at it as a new type of game as opposed to an RTS, and casual gamers will find they can play and enjoy the game even without being fans of RTS's. As such the game fits a nice niche along with an amazing price. If a person can look past a few flaws then they should find an enjoyable game for a low price.",
"Even though it is a remake of a fifteen year old game, Guardian Heroes still manages to feel fresh. Guardian Heroes suffers from some balancing and control issues, but it proves that great entertainment never grows too old.",
"Pac-Man World: Re-PAC is a classic from the end of the 90's with improved mechanics and graphics at today's level. Those who have played the original game will be delighted with this one although they will miss the original difficulty. However, anyone can give it a try and not miss out on this classic among classics.",
"Wattam flaunts the same absurd, childlike humor that Katamari Damacy did, setting the bases of its design in the logic of the playground, but this time Takahashi offers a different game - a miniature sandbox in which the rhythm is dictated by the player, with a fine story and dozens of lovely characters.",
"Aside from the neo-retro presentation and moving some actions to separate buttons, River City Saga: Three Kingdoms delivers almost exactly what its concept suggests. It plays like one of the best beat-em-ups from thirty years ago, with all that implies. The farcical retelling of the Three Kingdoms provides a fun excuse for the action, and you’ll have a whole lot of goofy thrills if you opt to play it via the extensive co-op multiplayer options. I could do without the terrible platforming bits and I wish it had the courage to shake the formula up a little more, but those who love River City will find this scratches the itch well enough.",
"Lively combat and fun scenario design plaster over the narrative cracks. Not the glorious last hurrah we'd hoped for, but as fun as Wii games are going to be in a dry 2012. [Feb 2012, p.92]",
"Might & Magic Heroes VI's entire experience is driven by repetitious, mechanical tactics; it should be reserved for those with masochistic tendencies. The average gamer should definitely pass this up.",
"Even with all that fanboyism, I came into this game with optimism tempered by mediocre expectations. It failed to meet even them. The game is just plain bad. It feels underdeveloped, hacked together and downright shoddy.",
"If you are looking for a fresh, action based game to download, Blade Kitten is a great option. While the gameplay might not be purfect, Krome Studios has poured a lot of love into this one to make Blade Kitten stick out from the bunch.",
"Killer Is Dead is a real missed opportunity. The fighting mechanics are there, the ideas are there, but the end result is just so totally average. It’s a game that’s hard to dislike, but also one that fails to impress on pretty much every level.",
"While the open ended gameplay is a good concept, it falls flat because players often end up lost or on an incorrect path. Romancing Saga almost focuses entirely on being open ended and it neglects all the other RPG mechanics like a solid story.",
"As a remake, Pac-Man World Re-Pac definitely ticks plenty of boxes when it comes to transforming an older game into one that fits into the present gaming landscape. The platforming is solid, the presentation is up to snuff, and there is no beating nostalgia sometimes. The game is unlikely to garner a new following save for a curious bunch, and is purely aimed at hardcore Pac-Man fans who are looking for something new yet old to enjoy, yet, that is not such a bad thing after all.",
"One could make a long list of things that Jupiter Hell isn’t, but that would be missing the point and the prize. Jupiter Hell is an easy-to-understand, but challenging and addictive roguelike, with turn-based action that never gets bogged down with the minutiae of facing, hexes, grids, or overly-complex mechanics. Instead, it zeroes in on cover, position, tactics, and the smart use of the tools at hand. The procedurally generated elements are the stuff of hit and miss, luck of the draw, run-ending frustration, and occasionally some pretty barren levels. Aside from that, Jupiter Hell is a focused and fun homage to an era of shooter where you never knew what was around the next dark corner.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles is one of the greatest video games ever created and this Definitive Edition manages to make it even better. Plus, the lovely bonus chapter acts as a delightful cherry on top.",
"The main mantra of Splatoon 2 seems to be ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’, and this is fine. This new Switch offering is robust, full of content and fun. Go and feed your hungry home-handheld hybrid.",
"I'm really struggling to find anything good to say about Jagged Alliance: Rage, other than that its name is appropriate. I suppose the stealth mechanic sort of works, although even there occasionally your sneaky work can be ruined by a patrolling soldier somehow glitching and eternally clambering on and off a rock instead of completing his route. Each playable character has a background trait that is supposed to play out as a weakness but that you rarely notice in play. The characters you choose to play seem irritated by one another, and by everything going on around them all the time. I've got to say, I think it's pretty understandable.",
"Despite being an undeniably beautiful piece of work, its identity as a weapon combat game lacks edge. I’m glad I stuck with it until the end – some of the late-game setpieces are certainly a sight to behold – but I left Trek to Yomi in a hungry search for something else that would give me the inherent satisfaction that comes from feeling the impact and hearing the sound of crossing blades.",
"I was fascinated by the aforementioned RPG elements though and would like to have seen a more dynamic struggle, somewhere in-between the grandeur of ""Total War"" and the intimacy of ""X-Com,"" where you could take your band of survivors to different areas of conflict with whatever equipment you can lay your hands on.",
"Hunt the Night is close to being a great Bloodbourne-inspired Souls-like, but it suffers from a midgame area that's a chore to navigate and a late game difficulty spike that goes beyond punishing and straight into sadistic. Some of this could be adjusted in updates, but as things stand, I can only recommend this title to those who really want to challenge themselves. If that sounds like you, then there is much to like.",
"Killer is Dead is a pure Suda51 game, crazy in its story, background, sequences and graphics. But despite some flashes of genius, it is actually quite classic and not so surprising.",
"The Madden game franchise seems to be on a gradual climb towards perfection that shows no signs of ever stopping. After all Madden EA Sports has produced, you have to wonder if they will ever stop, even when they have perfected their craft. Madden NFL 10 is closer to the real sport of football than anything we have ever played.",
"Alwa's Legacy is a good throwback to the Metroidvania games that inspired many titles in the genre. It features responsive gameplay, clever puzzles, and great visuals. While there isn't much reason to revisit the adventure, fans of the genre will find fun in Zoe's adventure.",
"A great start for the fighting genre in PSVita and an excellent port of the original PS3 game from last November. It includes an easily forgettable touch mode, but its gameplay is great, its traditional controls are splendid and it offers lots of characters, although falls short in gameplay modes for one player.",
"The action is always exciting and absorbing while the sword-play is refreshing, innovative and dynamic. The cut-scenes are brilliantly produced and the boss battles tense and engaging.",
"A game that tries to be every major street driving game you can imagine. At the end of the day, Driver: Parallel Lines feels a bit dated and jaded. Some fun car chases and over-the-roof-top racing, though. And yes, good music. [Apr 2006]",
Revengeance is a dynamic and fun game to play thanks to its protagonist and several good design choices. On the other hand from the development team of Bayonetta we would have expected a better combat system.,
"It isn't a particularly intense game and doesn't make use of all of the platform's capabilities. However, if you come at Digging Strike expecting much of the same gameplay elements that made the original Dig Dug such a popular title, then Digging Strike will be right up your alley.",
"More characters, amazingly detailed courses, the Double Dash idea, unlockable vehicles, and other secrets prove that Mario Kart: Double Dash is a huge improvement over previous games in the series.",
"Even better than Frogwares’ previous attempts at creating an accurate representation of the character and sleuthing of Sherlock Holmes, therefore elevating it to being the best videogame adaptation of the character and story thus far.",
The FPS doesn't launch with much of a bang on the Vita. Resistance is a decidedly average game with major control and graphics issues that make it a chore more often that you'd like. The promise of competitive online is mostly squandered.,
"Extremely similar to the previous games, but if you care more about the series' engaging turn-based gameplay and colorful presentation, you'll find enough in Winds of War to keep you busy for some time.",
"If Troy isn't the best Total War, it's one of the most convincing Total War Saga games. Overall the recipe for the IP doesn't change much, which is a bit sad for newcomers, but will delight the fans of the series.",
"With a unique protagonist, killer art style, savvy level design, and ferocious combat, there's little left for an action fan to want, while the role-playing elements have been enhanced to such a degree that the overall experience feels deeper and more compelling than before. If this game is not a success, then truly the world doesn't know what's good for it.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a confident and addictive reminder of why Monkey Ball was so popular back in the day. It truly feels like a celebration of the franchise that’s jam-packed with content, bonuses, and unlocks. Monkey Ball still holds up with addictive challenge, fantastic music and a goofy, yet endearing premise, and all of it is accentuated by small yet meaningful additions that makes it more accessible than ever before.",
"It serves as a good addition for those who enjoyed the main game, but in its own right it's too shallow to sustain much interest and gets xtremely repetitive xtremely quickly. [PSW]",
"If your bank account can withstand the investment for those pro instruments, or even if you want to keep playing the old way, Rock Band 3 is now the new benchmark of music games for groups. The Keyboard is a true bonus, especially in pro mode, and the Pro Guitar a real challenge for die hard gamers. Still blessed with its spot-on gameplay, as a videogame, it is beyond reproach and will entertain you for hours. But in terms of music teaching tool, we're not quite there yet. Only time will tell if the public will follow, and if the pro mode will indeed lead to new vocations, like the drums addition in the original Rock Band did. But Harmonix made progress and invested in innovation, while its competitors laze, and one may only applaud for that.",
"The story is such fun, and its world rendered with such affection for the source material (and for Victoriana, in general), that you can’t help but be swept up in the mystery. [September 2016, p74]",
"Commandos: Origins is a well-executed nostalgia trip. Those expecting a major leap forward for the genre may end up disappointed, as Claymore Game Studios’ work closely follows the traditional blueprint of classic real-time tactics games, with only a handful of modern adjustments—aside from a much-needed quick save system. The end result is a game that’s as challenging as it is intriguing, rewarding well-thought-out strategies and the occasional bit of improvisation. That said, some clever ideas can fall apart due to a few too many technical hiccups—issues we hope will be ironed out with future patches.",
"When taken as a whole, La Pucelle: Tactics is a great strategy/RPG loaded with hours upon hours of solid gameplay, multiple endings, side-quests, and a high degree of customization. [June 2004, p.91]",
"A brilliant fantasy turn-based strategy which borrows the best parts from those who came before. You’re going to manage cities in the vein of Civilization, fight battles reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic, but mainly you’re going to lead your people and shape them through magical evolution, resulting in a myriad combinations and playstyles. This is what a fun, addictive strategy game looks like.",
"Simultaneously increasing the realism of the experience of big mountain boarding and tearing the throat out of board-physics as we know it, SSX 3 completely revolutionizes the snowboardercross concept.",
"OVIVO may be a bit artsy for some people, but the game is relatively short and always throwing something new your way. Even if it doesn’t leave a lasting impression, the game is good while it lasts.",
"In a nutshell, it's a great table for newbies and pinball wizards alike, that can offer tons of fun even to those who are not particularly crazy about flipping metal balls around, but are into Portal.",
"Forget the cheesy story, the occasional bad camera and the fact that MGR:R is about as stealthy as a snowflake in a coal mine. The game knows that it’s a winner on the action front, and it takes steps to make certain that that is what gamers come back for. Sure, it may be over quickly, but with VR missions, secrets, easter eggs and upgrades, it’s worth replaying a few times.",
"With some quite tricky puzzles, Ever Forward is a rather challenging puzzler. The luscious graphics and lovely soundtrack definitely help the experience, but I’d have liked a bit more game. The pacing is a touch on the slow side too, so not one for the impatient.",
"Dark Sector is recommended to any gamer looking for a gruesome fix of body slicing action, and whilst the game is not near as bad as the media has perceived, it is undoubtedly going up against a strong line-up of first-person shooters currently on the Xbox 360.",
"EA Sports FC 25 brings the feeling of having more challenging and theoretically fair gameplay. And in the end, that’s what matters. The pursuit of realism is almost utopian – after all, we’re talking about a video game, not a live broadcast of a real match. So, of course, there need to be some more arcade-like elements and mechanics that make the game more fun.",
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles delivers an imaginative and colourful atmosphere that's contained within its own unique fantasy land. It's great fun to explore, learn skills, complete quests, and befriend the residents and the local wildlife. I only wish there was a clearer sense of direction and the ability to traverse this wondrous land more efficiently.",
"The Expanse arrives with plenty of narrative grace, interesting characters, and fun gameplay implements that put a heavy emphasis on exploration and discovery – but time will tell if Telltale can retain its high-velocity momentum in future installments.",
"A fitting sequel and takes several important strides forward for the franchise. The strengthening of the multiplayer adds some much needed replayability, the sense of scope and scale is impressive and allowing you to see the climactic battle through the eyes of a smorgasbord of Autobots and Decepticons, each with wildly differing play styles was a definite step in the right direction.",
"As with all of the games I've played in the EA Street series, you'll eventually start to realize that this is a game based on the amount of trickery you can pull off, rather than the real sport of soccer, which results in a stale and monotonous gaming experience.",
"We'll happily put our hands up and admit to our slight over-reliance on the phrase “if you like Command & Conquer, you’ll like this” when reviewing the more arcadey RTS games over the years, but this time it’s a necessity. Fans of the C&C series will quite simply find this to be nothing less than absolutely essential.",
Telltale’s Game of Thrones should be the end of any debate as to whether or not Telltale can apply its adventure game formula to any adaptation you throw at it. I saw things in Telltale’s rendition of the Game of Thrones universe that rivaled the awfulness I’ve seen on the show. I jumped from playing the post-apocalyptic Fallout 4 to playing Game of Thrones and didn’t feel like I was killing any fewer people.,
"Singstar Ultimate Party is a fail, and the main part of it is because of the very bad quality of the smartphone app and the lack of true multiplayer mode which would involve more than two singers.",
"While I think it's kind of neat to have a big party of six tearing through dungeons, controlling them all during real-time combat is a bit cumbersome, and I wish the loot was a bit more inspiring than the generic fare you find here. [Mar 2007, p.95]",
"Madden fans will find the play selection here a little tricky to get to grips with at first. Gone are Madden&#146;s pop-up menus, but once you get the feel of it NFL 2K is just that little bit more satisfying to play.",
"Are you looking for a platform game that is both colorful and original? Then Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is probably for you! On this compilation which brings together the first two opuses of the Klonoa series, Bandai Namco and the Monkey Craft studio deliver a solid redesign work, especially notable on the founding part. Despite a simple technique, the levels are colorful and very enjoyable to navigate. Of course, the level design remains that of a title from the end of 1990 and the beginning of 2000, which is felt in particular on Klonoa 1. Despite everything, the epic is enchanting and finds its climax during the second episode. In short, a nice nostalgic parenthesis!",
"Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is an excellent time with bags of replay value, potential in its online leaderboards and competitive play, and works a treat in local co-op thanks to the fun, if sometimes superficial minigames.",
If you’re thinking of revisiting Onimusha or just curious to try it for the first time then it’s a solid recommendation as a short and action-packed classic game with some good replay value after your first run. This just goes to show that a port in the right hands means it’s a good time to revisit older series that might now be forgotten.,
"F1 fans may lap it up, but for non-aficionados the series remains as niche as ever. For something a little more accessible from their driving stable, GRID 2 may be a better alternative.",
"The harder boss fights, longer levels, destructible environments, and the on-foot levels add to the already amazingly fun to play and, in my opinion, one of the best XBLA games making it a must buy if you were a fan of the original and have some points to spare.",
"Overall I felt disappointed in Paleo Pines. The world is bright, colorful, and fun to be in. The dinosaurs are truly adorable. Playing the flute to learn their song to befriend them is a very unique experience. But the rest of the execution is just mediocre at best. Forgettable quests, roadblocks on things that just aren’t fun, cost of supplies is too high, and the fact we can’t even go into our house is a real bummer. The quality of life things that we all basically expect in games these days just aren’t there. I’d love to see some changes made to the game. I honestly really did try to get into Paleo Pines because the visuals are adorable, but at the end of it all, I was left incredibly bored and lost interest.",
"Perks like starting races in 9th place don't provide a real substitute. Furthermore, online multiplayer's omission is also disappointing, though at least there's local multiplayer for up to four players. These aren't deal breakers, though, and when the core campaign is this good, New Star GP comes recommended.",
"Lumines: Electronic Symphony is the perfect culmination of simple game design and stellar presentation. There's a great depth of challenge for those who wish to find it, but the game never shuts out more casual players with crushing difficulty.",
"I think Rainbow Skies is an excellent title for any RPG enthusiast who isn’t locked to an aggressive review schedule or an ever-expanding backlog. If you’re the sort of person who delights in maxing out skills and levels of all sorts, you’ll want to check out Rainbow Skies.",
"Need for Speed: Unbound is a particular project, capable of forcefully bringing street culture back into fashion, the contemporary one of generation Z, but unable to create new spaces of playful expression. Everything that revolves around the characters in the story and our avatar works like a god, from the style chosen to describe them to the guide system, from the soundtrack to the graffiti-style special effects, in contrast with a Lakeshore which, despite its vibrant technical, remains an ordinary and almost anonymous city, a hub with a few collectibles scattered around that act as glue for a rather lazy play structure.",
"Fans of 4X gaming cannot really go wrong here. Endless Space 2 is a well-crafted game, that is expansive in all the right places, precise where it needs to be, complicated in an engaging way and truthfully, wonderful to look at. It’s also, after a bit of a time-investment (the tutorial is well-structured in this regard), pretty welcoming to any curious passers-by. Endless Space 2 has that special, addictive, one-more-turn quality about it. There is real style here, and a hell of a lot of substance to back it up.",
"Blade Kitten is, overall, a disappointing experience. While functional, it does little to impress and even though it may last a while, there is little impetus to play beyond the first level.",
"For the price of Criminal Girls, you could buy a whole bunch of sex toys, one of those big anime pillows with a naked girl on it, or some really nice handcuffs and a whip. Regardless of who you use them on, you’ll have more fun with them than you will with this game.",
"While the environment isn't as impressive as Morrowind or Summerset, Zenimax Online's storytelling is still impressive and entertaining. Unfortunately, the combat mechanics need a little more punch and the addition of dragons ends up be less impactful than advertised. It's a good expansion, but feels like a step down from the previous few.",
"If you loved the last series by Telltale, don't expect anything new from Game of Thrones. But if you're a big fan of Martin's fantasy saga you'll find those atmospheres, that characters ambiguity, that violence mixed with pettiness and intrigue that serves as a perfect springboard to dive into the usual Telltale game style.",
"Between the game sound and the game's eclectic soundtrack, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX is totally amazing...The soundtrack rivals ""Wipeout XL"" for the title of best licensed soundtrack ever.",
"The criteria for evaluating whether or not you should purchase it depends on your love for the saga, since, if you are looking for the latest news, it is a must-buy that will bring with it hundreds of hours of fun, but if your profile is not that Dude, could you wait a little longer.",
"If you come into this expecting a setting, cast or narrative similar to any of the anime, you might be left disappointed and confused. It’s still a fun, addictive game with the flashy combat you’d expect from a Warriors-style game, but you might have to tune out the story in order to enjoy it. In a franchise where story is so key, that’s a huge bummer.",
"While the strengths of DmC‘s balletic combat aren’t entirely lost in Vergil’s Downfall, they’re decidedly diminished. The novelty of a new playable character and slate of abilities is largely negated by the fact that Vergil isn’t nearly as smooth, interesting, or fun to control as his snarky twin brother.",
"If you've never played the first one, Redeemer is an entertaining, but repetitive, beat-em up action game with lots of style. But if you've played Hunter already, you'll be wishing the time between games had been used to make Redeemer a little deeper and more interesting than this repetitive slash-fest.",
"An innovative platform-puzzle-racer with a built-in track editor. Sluggish car handling and constant dying are big minuses, but do not destroy an otherwise excellent game. [Feb 2006]",
There’s a certain sense of satisfaction that comes from sneaking through an entire building of guards and making it out with a bag full of loot. It’s one that video games don’t take advantage of often enough. Monaco takes that and makes it an exciting and challenging affair to enjoy with friends. Just make sure you don’t sign up for the job if you plan to play alone.,
"Although frustratingly hard in places, most of the time Monaco is a delight to play. It looks great, has a wonderfully fitting soundtrack, and has simple gameplay while maintaining a high level of precision required to be really successful.",
"This is the Police 2 is a great sequel that polishes the original concept of the first entry. It’s more complex and mature, and also more enjoyable, and we think it deserves an opportunity.",
"With poor cover songs, a limited song selection, horrible graphics and a lack of online play, the game doesn’t really have much going for it. Even the kids preferred the original DDR SuperNova to this game—a major disappointment.",
"Dark Energy Digital sets the bar incredibly high for every other developer out there as a company that not only cares and supports their games but continuously strives to improve them even after they have your money. Hydrophobia: Prophecy is not only the best iteration of the game to date, it is by far the most visually stunning and engaging game I've played on my PC since Crysis 2, and for only $12 you won't find a better game or a better bargain.",
"While the uninspiring movie didn't help matters, it's the lethargic gameplay that winds up making King Arthur an equally disappointing game. Repetitive and frustrating, it fails to live up to the potential of its cinematic presentation.",
"Atari Flashback Classics for Switch is one of the biggest and best classic game compilations ever produced. Not only are there a ton of enjoyable games for any kind of gamer, everything is implemented spot-on for big screen or on-the-go retro fun.",
"Arkham Knight triumphs as a richly empowering comic book fantasy that sees its hero fail almost as much as he succeeds, making him the most believable, the most occasionally unlikeable, and ultimately the most heroic he’s ever been.",
"When all is said and done, Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star is a game primarily targeted to fans of the series. I find it tough to recommend Extella to complete newcomers. If Extella is your first exposure to the Fate series, I won’t blame you for being completely lost. There are serious problems in terms of content from a slim amount of modes to a tiny amount of stage variety. Its intriguing story is roughly 20 hours long with each of the four story routes lasting 4-6 hours long. Despite its genre shift from its predecessors, Fate/Extella is an enjoyable experience. It’s akin to a love letter to fans of the series. The more you know about Fate, the more you’ll enjoy this game.",
"Those looking for a challenge in planning, reflexes and dexterity – and those with the intestinal fortitude to witness the scads of gruesome deaths that result – will be well served by Hotline Miami.",
Topatoi: The Great Tree Story is a pretty good puzzle platformer that is hurt most by the episodic portion of its package since that means the game ends as you reach the end of the tutorial levels and are about to enter the meat of the game. It feels more like you’re getting one-third of a full game rather than something that’s truly episodic.,
"Diablo 2 remains an addictive experience capable of keeping you busy for hours. The endgame grind shows how far the genre has moved forward to embellish the loot piata, but its itemization remains unsurpassed and an example to follow.",
"So, if you can get past Iron Man's steep learning curve and a little bit of tarnish in the visual department, what are you left with? A game that's far from perfect, but still better than a lot of movie and comic book tie-ins that have come before.",
"Ultimately Side Order is a fun gameplay concept while it lasts. I’d suggest Splatoon fans play through the mode with each weapon once then bounce off. It’s a great game to play while listening to a podcast or something, but the lack of variety makes the mode get repetitive by the end especially if you’re trying to unlock everything. Hopefully this mode makes it into the inevitable next Splatoon with much more variety than what’s currently offered here.",
"Codemasters maintains its consistent and true F1 driving, adding classic cars in this edition, which is great news. However, the series is starting to lose innovation. The British developers must evolve next year if they don't want a drive-through.",
"The extreme difficulty of Team Ninja games, combined with jaw-dropping visuals and technically sound gameplay programming is what makes them so special. DOAU is a masterpiece for the reasons aforementioned, but also due to the fact that they did something that only one other developer has done so far - put 3D fighting online on the Xbox.",
"Let’s be clear for a moment: Forza Horizon has always been good. From the moment it burst onto the scene in 2012 as a spin-off to the core, more po-faced Forza Motorsport series, it established itself as a fun, thrilling, and subversively moreish alternative thread for racing on Xbox. It was in many ways the spiritual, open-world successor to Project Gotham Racing, and in turn traced its roots back to arcade racing royalty like OutRun. This is a tough lineage to stand up to, but Horizon 5 takes all that history and experience and runs with it, incrementally upgrading this series into must-play brilliance. It’s an achievement of a game.",
"A decent game with an original premise, good graphics, varied missions and solid multiplayer - it's a complete package for a low price, despite its strategic limitations. The shallow story and poor voice acting really hurt the experience, though.",
"Diablo II returns with refreshed graphics and unaltered gameplay (apart from some small improvements). It’s as fun as I remembered, so I quickly felt at home and gave in to nostalgia. However, it’s hard not to notice that beneath revamped visuals lies a 21 years old design. [12/2021, p.32]",
"It's been far too long since another game of such scope, breadth, and originality hit computer screens. Theatre of War--while having some significant problems--is a game well worth looking at.",
"The most disappointing thing about Exigo is that the gameplay just isn’t all that exiting. Everything looks nice and is well-balanced, but there’s little here that hasn’t been done before.",
"Whilst the missions are incredibly fun and engaging, the new watered down approach adopted by the developers seems to have hurt the game in my opinion, yes I prefer the original set up a lot more.",
"If they had trimmed all the meaningless RPG fat and reworked Enchanted Arms into something more concentrated, the experience would have played to the game's strengths and been more successful for it.",
"Tinykin brilliantly revisits the ""Pikmin-like"" by successfully adapting it to the platform game with puzzle-game inclinations. A true invitation to explore, one can only be fascinated by the incredible microscopic universe imagined by the Splashteam. Generous, teeming with details, full of humour, the Tinykin adventure will appeal to young and old alike. We want more!",
"A very intense, yet very short game which will be enjoyed by action fans, even if they are not fans of the Warhammer universe. It is incredibly fun, but it lacks more duration and an online mode.",
"Monster Energy Supercross 25 has truly won us over this year. While there are still some details that could use refinement in the future, the game arrives in great shape and shows strong potential for further improvement. The overhaul of the physics and dynamic system, for example, offers gameplay that feels well-suited to the current generation—though there’s still room for some visual enhancements. The career mode isn’t anything groundbreaking, but it does its job and allows us to enjoy the solid racing experience on track. On the other hand, the customization section really stands out, especially thanks to the new livery editor, which rounds out an already well-developed feature set. AI improvements are noticeable and welcome, but not yet fully satisfying—this may well be the area where the development team needs to focus most in future iterations.",
"In lieu of interesting situations, tactics, thrills, or simple variety, Starship Troopers coughs up a big greasy hairball of run-right-at-you enemies that never stop coming. [Mar 2006, p.55]",
"Characters are memorable and well drawn, literally and figuratively, and the game ably tackles thorny issues such as the consequences of school bullying, and the terrible toll taken by anxiety, depression and domestic abuse. For the most part, the 12-hour runtime flies by as you get to know every delightful nook and cranny of the cosy neighbourhood; only the final third drags a little. It feels worthwhile after the superb ending, though, which ensures that this game will live on in your memory for a long, long time after the credits roll.",
"Overall, Rabbids: Alive & Kicking is a good compilation of mini-games, though it's hard to recommend a purchase, especially at full price. The title could have done with more single player based content; however, it's a great game for a family who are looking for some light-hearted entertainment.",
"Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games has some of the best online capabilities on the Wii U, but it unwisely forces use of poor motion controls in almost every mode.",
"You’re in the Movies is largely a technological failure, making the game impossible to play at times. It’s fun to participate in the different minigames for a while, but the only reward is a minute-long trailer that is way too short to include enough images from the efforts everyone’s made during playing.",
"It may not be the ideal real-time strategy game for the player looking for another quick rush of multiplayer battles, but its production values are impeccably well done, its campaign is long and captivating, and its core gameplay is complex, tactical, and rewarding.",
"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is definitely a mixed bag. It's not a ""bad"" game per se despite having some poorly-executed parts to its gameplay, but it's also not as good as the franchise's best gaming entries either.",
"The phrase ""one for the fans"" has never been applied more honestly than in this case; it may be flawed, but we're happy to recommend Rise of a Ninja to Naruto fans - albeit with a few reservations. Believe it.",
"It says a lot that Jupiter Hell – a turn-based roguelike where mistakes end your entire run – can whisk your cautious sensibilities into an unadulterated blood frenzy at the drop of a shell. The game is a must-have for strategy fans and curious Doom fans alike – the unique pacing brings something new to the turn-based genre, while demon-slaying hobbyists will find that Jupiter Hell scratches the same itch for satanic butchering as all the greats. There’s some work to be done on stability – and more variance in builds wouldn’t go amiss – but Jupiter Hell is an incredible, hell-bound slaughter as it stands.",
"David Lynch isn't afraid to make art that is impenetrable, hard to interpret. That's part of his genius: the absurdity of horror, the natural beauty of the uncanny. Those Who Remain draws inspiration from him in surface alone. There's the diner, the winding road. But Edward's internal journey is afraid to say anything new or original. And as a result, the player isn't afraid at all.",
"In returning to its narrative adventure roots, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage feels like a retreat for Don’t Nod. Draped in nostalgia for both the 90s and Life is Strange, Bloom & Rage struggles to find itself among uneven pacing, tonal inconsistencies, and an uninteresting cast of characters. Despite some neat visual tricks with its VHS overlays, there’s little on this first tape worth a rental.",
"We have yet to play a perfect video game but Gears 2 get’s really freaking close; probably closer than any action game has gotten before. Every aspect of the game: gameplay, controls, features, graphics, and audio have a triple A feel to it and during the first play-through every single gamer will get multiple “oh sh.t” moments.",
"Buy into Arma 3 now and you’re buying into many promises. Bohemia’s pledge of a coherent campaign, its promise of a wider array of military toys to play with, and its intent to tweak and update AI errors, scripting issues, and pathfinding problems. But these promises are backed up by thousands of the world’s most dedicated players, people who’ve spent years crawling through Arma 2’s rough terrain to find the comparatively even ground of Arma 3. Buying Arma 3 at launch is buying a promise, then, but few games are so meticulously realised, or show so much promise.",
"However, while Fuel Overdose has its flaws it is still a good deal for its money. If you can get over one map having clipping issues, ignore the sound, and not care about story (it's a racing game after all) then you should find a nice cheap game that provides a lot of fun entertainment. And isn't that what video games are all about?",
"Still, there are very few tennis games on the Xbox 360 at the moment, and while hardened fans of the sport may want to hold off for Top Spin 3, Sega fans will lap this fan service up.",
"I didn't think pinball would work on such a small screen, but I was proven wrong by Zen Pinball 3D. The biggest drawback is the age of the tables, but the core mechanics provide fun and addictive pinball on the go.",
"Hard West 2 is a compelling turn-based tactics offering with a memorable style of combat. While the central story and the characters underpinning it may feel a little sketched out, the world and the little details within it are compelling. A rooting, tooting good time.",
"It's easy to look at Call of Juarez and see a game split down the middle, one half great and the other horrible, but to give it the credit it deserves, such a bold use of divided narrative just about makes it worthwhile for the most part with the style of both sections always perfectly in character and the ever switching perspective from hunter to hunted driving the game along even when the on screen action becomes less enjoyable.",
"Managing to encompass the feeling of a leisurely stroll through an idyllic, relaxing location, Spilled! has both a great message regarding the environment, while also being a relaxing experience in and of itself. The short runtime might leave you wanting a bit more, and the boat can occasionally feel a tad cumbersome, but Spilled! remains a visually lovely and atmospherically pleasant jaunt through waters ready for your clean up operation.",
"Fresh and funny, this cliché of a J-RPG offers a charming and substantial adventure with tints of self-derision based humor. Too bad though that it's sometimes hard to to wrap your brain around its almost too deep and complex systems.",
"Saturnalia is hard to call a must-play horror game, as it's likely to be polarizing both in terms of its presentation and its mechanics. A slower pace, somewhat minimalist gameplay, and mystery-laden narrative style will keep it from being everyone's cup of tea. Yet fans of exploration looking for a beautiful, atmospheric mystery (with just a handful of things that lurk in the dark) will find that Saturnalia is a wholly unique adventure that's well worth taking.",
"A frustrating port of an above-average game. Rather than attempting to significantly tweak Mafia's structure and narrative &#133; the developer has attempted to replicate the PC experience to the letter. It has been only partially successful. [Mar 2004, p.109]",
"For friends of ""Disgaea"" and ""Phantom Brave,"" La Pucelle Tactics guarantees entertainment for many hours. If the afore-mentioned games are not already familiar to you, La Pucelle is the one you should get, as it’s simplest and best of the three. [May 2005, p.64]",
"GRIP: Combat Racing is an unpolished gem that’s currently too flawed to fully recommend. When it comes together – particularly in multiplayer – GRIP is capable of providing some of the most engaging future racing this side of Wipeout 2097, but it’s all too easy for it to fall apart, especially when you’re placed in the hands of the game’s cheating AI.",
"Besides mildly satisfying swordplay (Grasshopper failed to come up with a really good combat system) Killer is Dead offered me nothing that could raise my blood pressure. [CD-Action 10/2013, p.60]",
"Despite a few glitches and omissions (no multiplayer or online options, although there is a map editor), expect Silent Storm to receive a noisily positive reception from the tactical strategy crowd.",
"Zen Pinball 3D offers four tables to be played : Excalibur, El Dorado, Earth Defense! and Shaman. Too bad those aren't new from the XBLA and PSN versions, and that the comfort of the 3DS screen isn't really one that suits certain camera angles. But the game still remains a good flipper title, with fair visuals, and once its 3D has been tamed, it's a good companion for nomad players who love to get extra balls.",
"Bouncing between comical yet often heartfelt dating segments and double-entendre-laden dungeon crawling combat makes for a good genre fusion that stays enjoyable for the 5-10 hours it takes to complete. The action might not hold up to scrutiny and some aspects of the dating sim might not land well for you, but the sum of Boyfriend Dungeon’s parts is greater than its pieces. The elevator pitch of dating your weapons is still as silly and goofy now as it was when the game was first revealed.",
"A unique blend of marble madness and tower defence that does become repetitive after a while, but sits nicely in the spot reserved for games that are great to dip into now and again.",
"If you are more into structured RPGs or adventures with a little more plot, story, and character interaction...you may want to run to the video store for this one and see if it's for you.",
"I'm totally for the idea of a nonviolent FPS, but this one just doesn't work on any level. It's like ""Catechumen's"" long lost pagan brother. It doesn't even make a good game for your kid brother or son who's hopped up on Atlantis fever. This is one empire that deserves to stay lost.",
"The Settlers: New Allies feels confused by its own identity. Is it a live service game? Is it a homage to the great RTS games of the past? Is it The Settlers, or a lesser Age of Empires? The answers seem to dance away the longer you play, and the further your settlements grow. While it houses a gorgeous world that actively encourages you to keep exploring, placing roads, and looking after your flock, a lack of depth and identity makes New Allies feel like a muddled experiment.",
"The real icing on the cake here though is the incredibly flexible track editor that comes with the game. Not only is extremely complete and fully functional, it is also very easy to use and administer.",
"A game with such iconic characters should be much better. It can be fun when played with some friends, but it doesn't make much use of the great possibilities the Wii U GamePad can offer.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is a must buy game for racing fans and casual gamers alike. I don’t know how, but Playground Games has made gains over Horizon 4 that I really didn’t think would be possible. The visuals are stunning, the sound is amazing, the number of things to do is almost overwhelming and the gameplay feels refined, making it an amazing open world racing game experience. The freedom to go pretty much anywhere in the Mexican will eat up a lot of time. Sure, there have been network issues, but these seem to be disappearing, allowing for an almost flawless experience. So, why are you still reading, go play this game on Game Pass, or flip a few extra dollars for the deluxe version and you get the VIP ranking, access to two expansions and a few extra cars that you might most likely enjoy.",
"To the question if Monochroma meets the high expectations raised from the Kickstarter campaign, the answer is no. However, despite the game's mediocrity, there are some glimpses of quality and since it's the studio's first attempt, there could be better results in the future.",
"If you like retro shooters and relax by blowing stuff up, Crimsonland is an easy way to spend a few afternoons as long as you don't expect anything groundbreaking. Some of you may want to stay away unless you have constant access to couch co-op, as it can overstay its welcome after every mission is said and done.",
"Critter Café is full of lost potential. While it’s cute, runs well, and has simple controls, it’s held back by repetitive gameplay, limited activities, and childish dialogue. With more world interaction and expanded gameplay, it could have been a far more enjoyable long-term experience.",
"This is a solid game overall -- and without a doubt, All-Pro Football should continue building on this foundation. But if you were expecting 2K euphoria after two years on the sidelines, you'll be disappointed, as this one's got rust in many of the wrong places.",
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos is an adorable yet challenging dungeon crawler designed to play with friends and suitable for any character class. Its world is exciting, its style is lovely and it has a lot going for it that draws you into the adventure.",
Concord will forever be remembered as one of the most notorious flops in the entire industry. And yet there is hope that at least some lessons can be learned from this whole ordeal.,
"The First Berserker: Khazan delivers an excellent Soulslike experience that most of the fans of the genre will enjoy. The parry system might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the game still delivers an excellent gameplay experience sprinkled with amazing boss fights.",
"Part Time UFO is simple, it's cute and it's a huge dose of fun. This port of the 2018 mobile game comes with numerous additions for Nintendo Switch, and might just be the best co-op title on the console for some time.",
"Lumines Plus on the PS2 scores points simply for being a great game and cheap as balls, but alas, this is the frailest version we’ve ever encountered recently (single player, versus, time trial and puzzle mode - that's it), so you know we’ve got to dock it.",
"Soaked! is very typical, but also a bit more expansive expansion than these things usually end up being. The original is already a good game, so more variety is always welcome. Soaked! even manages to improve the basic gameplay of the original, which not many expansions manage to do. [August 2005, p.77]",
"Elsweyr is a great expansion pack with a lot of new contents, dragons and necromancer. If you haven't play The Elder Scrolls Online yet, this is a great way to enjoy the one of the best MMORPG in market. It is funny, addictive and for moments, epic too.",
"The replayability of Go Mecha Ball comes purely from how much fun it is. A handful of ending scenes are available after multiple completions, but these cartoon-y, still images won't rank among the best games with multiple endings, and the first completion on max difficulty unlocks a unique upgrade. But these rewards don't amount to much. Nevertheless, players will likely pick up the game again and again because it just feels that good. Though imperfect,there's simply nothing quite like Go Mecha Ball out there, and it deserves to be experienced.",
"It's a neat idea, to be sure, but its execution leaves an awful lot to be desired. If anything, air hockey in VR is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of minutes. This, however, is in no way enough to justify the price tag.",
"Samurai Warriors 4: Empires is a good step in the right direction, with a lot more depth and strategics thanks to the Politics Phase. But the gameplay itself is still the same compared to the original and the graphics have not improved either.",
"Curse of the Crimson Elixir, despite being ridiculously short and a bit too easy for advanced gamers, delivers a fun, beautiful and enthralling story experience that puts its anime license to perfect use.",
"Those who have played the other games like this could very well be scratching their heads at why they're playing the same game as before. The old thrills are still here and it's possible to get right back into it as before, but the same rush and level of addiction is harder to attain this time around.",
"It's like exhuming a dead relative only to find that he can't shake his state of decay or that rotting smell. Okay it's not that bad, but I couldn't resist a little tasteless metaphor.",
"Endless Space 2 is a great 4X strategy game that is almost guaranteed to improve. While not free of bugs, including a few large ones, it's a title that oozes character. Each and every game offers the flexibility to play the way you want to and adapt as you please, while offering some excellently told stories with every game also offering a fresh emergent story to boot.",
Nintendo went ahead and cemented itself as not only the oddball of the gaming industry but as the king of left field. The Labo has some great ideas stored inside of it and the experience itself of building the Toy-Cons was quite enjoyable – albeit a bit shallow in terms of some of the games.,
"In a world where everything moves fast, Lushfoil Photography Sim’s tranquil experience provides the perfect getaway for those looking to slow down and truly appreciate life's beauty.",
"To say that The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D is the stand out best game in the Zelda series is, indeed, a daring - and inaccurate - verdict, given the calibre of the series. However, there can be no doubting that this is the most alluring and positively tortuous game within the series, and for that reason alone, it is worth everyone's time.",
"As long as you don’t expect too much – or, I guess, as long as you just want more of what was in Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2 – then Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3 does just enough to be worth playing.",
"It's a great game for Final Fantasy fans, and fans of JRPGs, though unlike Pokemon Let's Go, it's not going to be super easy for younger kids to get the most out of a complex battle and leveling system.",
"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance could have been something big like a successful spin-off, but from my point of view Platinum Games featured too much action and to little gameplay depth in the game. The difficulty level is high and the game is too short. All in all it’s a nice game for core genre fans, but no more.",
"Mugen Souls is the very definition of a 'good' game. Whilst it'll never blow you away, and there are certainly a number of issues, there's also plenty to do and a varied cast of characters to escort you on this bizarre adventure. If you're after an RPG that isn't quite the norm, then Mugen Souls is worth a look.",
"SportsBarVR is a solid collection of multiplayer sports bar games, with pool and darts being the stand out experiences. However, the other experiences on show seem to have been rushed a little to hit PlayStation VR's release date, and the small pool of online players detracts from the overall appeal of the package a little.",
"Foretales is a wonderful example of how creative the card-based genre can be. Marrying a gripping narrative with gameplay that really makes you feel in charge of your own destiny, this is an engaging and fulfilling experience that we whole-heartedly recommend. It can take a little while to fully get your bearings, what with so many different cards in play at any one time, but it’s absolutely worth sticking with.",
"Combines a wide-open, free-roaming world with nifty physics, torturous terrain, awesome special effects, and more environments, vehicles, and gameplay modes than any other off-road title.",
"Because of the relative simplicity of the puzzles, the game plays more like an interactive movie or novel than it does a true game, but its story is so compelling that you may not mind too much.",
"Boston Lockdown has a serviceable story, but its lack of branching dialogue options and its heavy emphasis on combat render it a less satisfying experience compared to its recent Shadowrun peers.",
"What's most frustrating about Tiberium Wars is that it chooses not to accentuate the breakneck battlefield thrills of C&C's arcade stylings, opting instead to preserve the old blueprint. [May 2007, p.86]",
"Being their ""first true big project"", Beenox successfully pulled off what seemed to be an impossible task for many of us within the game industry. With Shattered Dimensions, Beenox stays true to the colourful and adventuring character of Spider-Man and propels him back into the spotlight.",
"Plays remarkably well. Featuring lots of interesting, inventive design decisions, plenty of fun-to-use units, and tons of variety, Age of Mythology is the last real-time strategy game you'll need for a long time.",
"Almost a decade after it's initial release in Japan, the Definitive Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles shows us, more than anything, why JRPG fans in the US were so adamant on bringing it to the states.",
"A sequel that's good but not great. It's got mini-games that will hook you immediately, a stronger emphasis on group play, and some genuinely hilarious moments. It's also got some bad mini-game mechanics that are recycled throughout the experience that drag it down.",
"Those Who Remain is difficult to recommend, but there is an interesting meditation on guilt, redemption, and judgement hidden amongst an unfortunate mass of clunky design and gameplay. It might even be that watching someone else play the game is the best way to enjoy it, so you won't have to fight the controls and frustrating checkpoints. Ultimately, the game itself fails to live up to the potential of its ideas. This is one that should remain on the shelf.",
"A host of minor improvements, a revitalized manager career mode, impressively deep tactical options, and a solid new game mode. EA Sports FC 25 still has some on-pitch shortcomings, as usual, but overall, this year’s entry is surprisingly well-executed.",
"Without the online multiplayer to sustain the title outside of its short lived single player campaign, there just isn’t that much game here and even though it’s priced well at a modest $9.99, I feel it’s a title for the hardcore boxing game fans that have been waiting for a dose of action on the go and nobody else.",
"The geneticists at Frontier have managed to ""clone"" a version of Jurassic World Evolution that fits in Nintendo Switch and works perfectly, with cutbacks in resolution, but the benefit of portability. As a sim game it falls short in creative options, but it makes up for that with a fine campaign, beautiful dinosaurs and tons of fan service.",
"If FFXIII was an exercise in form over function, its successor is exercise in working with what you've got – and doing a brilliant job of it (for the most part). It does some things better than its predecessor, some things worse, but what's most impressive about Final Fantasy XIII-2 is how much feels new and different, despite sharing most of its guts with XIII.",
"Overall, Rock Band 3 does a great job of refining the music game experience while at the same time pushing it forward by blurring the line between playing a music game and actually playing music.",
"Whilst very brief and slightly obsolete in its gameplay, Sunlight provides an ambitious and rich narrative experiment, offering keen insight into concepts of impermanence, sensation and mortality.",
"It's a complex game, and surely not a mainstream one. If you're looking for something different, and you are interested in Philip K. Dick's works, you might find something really interesting here.",
"Summon Night 5 is a very enjoyable experience. Even if the story segments can be tedious, I still found myself playing for hours on end. If you have an old PSP, or better yet, a Vita hanging around, you should consider giving Summon Night 5 a try.",
"There are moments when Tape 1 stumbles. Performance issues crop up from time to time. I noticed pop-ins pretty consistently when the story switched from third-person to first-person. And the frame rate chugged for me in a climactic moment towards the end of the chapter. But the game's bigger problem is that Lost Records continues Don't Nod's penchant for corny dialogue. Some of that stems from the game incorporating dated '90s slang like ""parental units"" and ""geez-o,"" which works well enough as period language. But one big late-game moment, where a character attempts to make a serious point by reciting lyrics to a punk song, falls especially flat. But the game's utter sincerity is a major point in its favor, and these kinds of missteps are a side effect. If I have to put up with some deeply goofy choices in order to get a character as heartbreakingly earnest as Swann Holloway, I'll accept the trade-off.",
"Both a great action game and a really fun strategy game, 'Empires' might not appeal to most 'Warriors' fans, as the new elements can seem intimidating and almost jarring when put next to the combat, but for those who put the time in, there's a lot of complexity and fantastic ideas to be found here, making this one of the best 'Warriors' games to date.",
"On its own merits, this expansion is a reasonably good deal, but it's best suited for the hard-core Disciples II fan who wishes to play every single official scenario for the game.",
"Focused in its style, single minded in its vision and executed with superb finesse, it’s a fantastic example of what can be achieved on PSP with imagination and skill. [July 2007, p.111]",
"Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a game for Persona fans, a game for rhythm genre fans, and definitely a game for Persona fans who love rhythm games (like me). Perhaps more importantly, it’s a milestone for rhythm games, pushing the bounds of mastery and player-defined difficulty, and demonstrating that this genre has as much capacity for a deep and compelling narrative as any other.",
"Kung Fu Rabbit serves as a nice snack for those on the hunt for 2D-platformers, but when it comes to challenge it doesn't even hold a candle to some of the bigger titles out there. It also lacks personality and the story and setting are very generic. It's still good for an entertaining afternoon though.",
"A solid RTS game, one that fans of the genre will probably enjoy. However, anyone who’s growing bored of playing the same WWII sim game in different forms wouldn’t find too much to write home about.",
"With New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Mario goes back to his roots. The game is quite challenging, but never too difficult thanks to the new Super Guide option. However, it’s the brilliant multiplayer that makes NSMB Wii such a great game.",
"With a revamped mission structure, online play, and brand new control scheme Armored Core 4 is a must own for fans of the series like myself. While there are a few glaring problems the core experience is still enjoyable.",
"Folks, there is a lot to this game; it might not be a pure railroad / train management simulator, but it has a lot to offer, especially if you like puzzles. Everything runs very smoothly, and I didn't find any bugs. Some of the missions will require you to start from scratch where you need to locate resources, build or rather place the appropriate resource gathering buildings, assign the necessary workers and lay down rails, place stations, set the switches while adding the needed trains and its cars. Other missions might provide a jumbled-up mishmash collection of broken rails that need to be fixed and improved. Every mission will be different from the previous ones.",
"Iro Hero is certainly a very challenging and tough 2D shoot'em up whose similarities with other old-school classics of the genre will not go unnoticed. It's also a very hardcore experience, tailored mostly to players looking for a challenge of the kind, rather than for the general audience and this is where its biggest weakness lies.",
"EA FC 25 doesn't live up to its launch price. The game has limited improvements, especially in terms of gameplay, which make it only worth it for those who play competitive mode, or for those who can't live without Ultimate Team.",
"After nearly 25 years Bandai Namco gives us the opportunity to (re)discover two great classic platform games. A quite good remaster that could have been far better with some extra material, and the addition of the chapters released on portable consoles.",
Shadowrun Chronicles Boston Lockdown is an online tactical RPG marred with quite many issues. Still its gameplay idea is solid and the multiplayer mode could be quite a joyous experience. Given enough time to devs to solve its issues it could reach unexpected heights.,
"Despite one or two small complaints, Need for Speed Unbound is a great arcade racer, finally getting the series back on track. The versatile handling feels fantastic, and the single-player offers a highly engaging campaign, pitting you against the cops and other racers in equal measure. The much talked-about cartoon effects succeed in bringing some flair to the experience, and it all runs wonderfully at 4K and 60 frames-per-second. If you can forgive a slightly underwhelming backdrop and a barebones online mode, the minute-to-minute action make this more than worth taking for a spin.",
"Revita is a dynamic, roguelite, twin-stick, 2D action platformer that redefines the control scheme in a mind-boggling fashion, yet if you get used to it… You will be in for quite a ride.",
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Collection demonstrates both why these games are fondly remembered and why Klonoa didn’t go on to become more famous. Flawed gems perhaps, but important ones.",
EA Sports FC 25 is one of the better successor of the recent EA Sports FC-history. Rush is a pure joy to play and fits the series well. FC IQ delivers more depth and – despite some balancing-issues – impacts the match-flow significantly.,
"Published by Private Division, Piccolo’s platformer set in a post-human world is a solid offering and another reminder that indie games can provide well-rounded, memorable experiences. After Us can be completed in about 10 hours, 20 for thorough explorers, and nearly every minute of it will be enjoyable. The visuals are impressive, the gameplay is fun, the levels are varied, and though the story is rather simplistic and a bit vague, it serves its purpose. After Us probably won’t rise to the top for many people, but it definitely won't sink to the bottom either.",
"Warlords useless original version and some odd Achievement quirks (I met the goal for 3 Achievements but never received points for them) take some shine off this updated classic, but for $5 this title is a bargain.",
"A fun, exciting and action-packed game. Beneath its cute exterior beats a heart of granite and any negative aspects are outweighed by points of excellence that allow it to move self-assuredly through the mountain of faceless Gameboy titles. [JPN Import]",
"The success of a Total War depends on the delicate balance between the turn-based portion of the game and the real-time strategic battles. While the latter are deep and with very few smudges, the former is extremely unbalanced and presents a series of issues – in some cases quite serious – that undermine the whole experience.",
"Fallen Legion shows all the potential in the world to become a great IP. The core ideas are strong, and the attempt to tell an interesting, deep story is admirable. Unfortunately this one doesn’t execute on its ideas as well as it should, and, critically, this lets down the game's themes, but it is on the cusp of being something special.",
"The main problem with the game is also one of its strengths. The fact that it has only Corvette cars will definitely turn people off the game, but also attract a niche market of those who can't get enough one of the most famous American muscle cars.",
There’s a lot to like with this remaster and I hope Capcom considers remastering the others for Switch (and PS4 and Xbox One) in the future because some aspects haven’t aged well but this is a damn fine experience. I’ve grown to enjoy playing many older games on handheld systems and Onimusha is best on Switch for me.,
"The 3DS eShop is home to some truly amazing titles, and Hydroventure: Spin Cycle is another upstanding addition to that stellar selection. It successfully builds on the foundations laid down by its WiiWare parent and delivers a physics-based puzzle experience which challenges the very best the genre has to offer.",
"Another fun piece of Splatoon single-player DLC, with an interesting mix of third person shooter and roguelike that would’ve been much better as the main story mode from the start.",
"The Settlers: New Allies is a game with great presentation and poor execution, It’s $60, but I would struggle to recommend it at even half that price given how lacking in content it is. The gameplay is lagging heavily. Although tightly woven together, it doesn't really matter when there's so little to play with. It’s like being in a sandbox with no toys or tools.",
"Trek to Yomi is a game with great promise that, unfortunately, fails to live up to expectations. Despite this, it also succeeds in areas where most games fail. Few games can lay claim to this level of stylistic fidelity. However, its shortcomings are too vast and all-encompassing to ignore. It feels like a game that tries desperately to be more than it is, to have more nuance, more to say. Unfortunately, it's not just the color scheme that's black and white.",
"Neople's The First Berserker Khazan is a success. While it opts for a classic structure and a level design without too many surprises, it pulls out all the stops with its gameplay, halfway between souls-like and beat'em all. Hyper-energetic and highly graphic, the combat system is a pure success. Despite the difficulty, which is not always well balanced, the game is not punishing, but rather rewards the slightest action. The build-up of power coupled with the feeling of accomplishment make The First Berserker Khazan a truly enjoyable and exhilarating experience. Not to mention its masterful, eye-popping art direction and, above all, its talent for staging boss battles, which spares nothing. An excellent surprise for the start of the year, and an excellent hardcore action game.",
"WiiWare's Sonic 4 may yet prove the bigger draw for fans, but it'll be a victory for hedgehogs past. True fans, those that really love and cherish the blue blur, should bet on Colours, because if Sonic is to have a future then that future starts here.",
"The game’s technical problems notwithstanding, I found LEGO City Undercover to be an immensely enjoyable adventure that really made me laugh. It certainly has a lot going for it with a great story, funny script, creative originality and a design that makes no attempt to dumb anything down making it easily accessible for gamers young and old alike. LEGO City Undercover is also a lovely looking game that continues the trend of blending real world objects and geography with colorful and whimsical LEGO objects. For those still upset about the delay over Rayman Legends, I’m pleased to say there’s finally a game that makes Wii U worth owning.",
"Whether you are striving for higher ranks or want to dazzle people with a map that you created and uploaded, TimeSplitters' online presence is unprecedented and simply irresistible. [Apr 2005, p.114]",
"Rock of Ages 2: Bigger & Boulder features a fantastic albeit familiar mix of genres that's sure to provide some great and often hilarious times. Although the fun factor doesn't last forever, what's here is definitely worth checking out.",
"Just like the Vita itself, Lumines Electronic Symphony is slick and at times irresistible, and well worth experiencing for yourself. Still, we can't help but feel that the $40 price is a tad steep for what it offers. Unless you absolutely can't wait to participate in this carnival of light, it's probably wise to wait until the price settles a bit.",
"Multiplayer over WiiConnect 24 works surprisingly well, but a functioning online system isn’t enough to get over the broken, unresponsive, and unentertaining fighting mechanics of the game.",
"Endless Space 2 brings 4X to life with a gorgeous presentation and a host of new approaches to a well-established genre. While a few bugs remain, Amplitude has patched the game twice in the last week. By all accounts, Endless Space 2 is easily one of the best examples of the genre.",
"In Shadowbane, the players get to remap the world, and that's something that just hasn't been done before. It's a significant achievement, and an engrossing gameplay experience that should be applauded, albeit cautiously.",
"While we were collecting clues and investigating the case, she was a lot of fun, but once the investigation stopped and the action started, she turned on me, leaving my heart cut open like a gutted fish.",
"When a classic is remastered, there is really only one mission: don’t mess it up. Monolith and Nintendo have admirably improved upon a Wii classic, delivering the one version of this game that people should now aim to play. It’s true that some of the original game design frustrations remain untouched and performance is solid but sadly not perfect. These things barely matter, though; Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition is easily a must-own for any RPG fan with a Switch.",
"A fun, playable and respectable effort at capturing the feel of World War II combat, but its magnificent cutscenes and (initially) superb soundtrack end up promising an experience that the blocky graphics, uninspired landscapes and poor sound effects can&#146;t make good on.",
"Ultimately, it’s hard for me to recommend RPG Maker Fes to anyone but the most hardcore of RPG fans that have always dreamed of creating their own game. You’ll certainly be limited by the tools (or lack thereof) available here, and the lack of a meaningful tutorial may hinder all but the most patient of designers. RPG Maker Fes feels like an incomplete product, like a beginner sewer’s kit that was shipped with only one color of thread and without instructions. You can definitely make an RPG if you’re patient enough, but it’s unlikely to come close to what you envisioned when you began, which is likely to leave you unsatisfied.",
"Gallop Racer 2006 is pretty proficient; it's just not a very inviting experience. Fans who have already acclimated themselves to the generally noninclusive tone of the franchise shouldn't have too much trouble digging through the clumsy interface and often clinical appearance, but it's probably not worth the trouble to anyone else.",
"For an add-on of only 9MB, Vae Victis added many things to a game already complex, with a learning curve that’s quite steep and not accessible to everyone. But those who will discover its secrets will be rewarded with a realistic and historical experience that will keep them glued to the computer for many hours on end.",
"Microsoft did the impossible, not only did they put out a superior game on their first spin around the track they did it in a big way that will force every other racer hoping to compete to evolve in more ways than one.",
"It's quite literally everything the first game was and more, which might not mean more revolutionary features but does mean a greater depth and variety of options for the new players it is sure to ensnare. With free updates promised for the best part of a year, the game will only improve, and this time it'll have the audience it deserves.",
"Knytt Underground is an odd game, and certainly a polarizing one, as some will greatly enjoy its ambiance and exploration-heavy gameplay, while others won't be able to overlook its terrible story and dialogue sections.",
"Although it’s best played in co-op mode, there’s a fair amount of fun to be had in playing alone too. Throw in the fact that Knights and Bikes features clearly defined mechanics along with some powerful instances and you’ve got yourself quite the charming indie experience.",
"Urban Trial Playground is a simple but direct arcade proposal, with a bombproof gameplay that will delight players who enjoy challenges. Its multiplayer mode is a great feature and it’s very fun.",
"Outrun Online Arcade is one of the indispensable downloadable games in the market. Thanks to its incredible gameplay, its addictive -although not very well taken the most of- and its features, untouched since the eighties, we can say this is currently one of the best arcade racers.",
While I commend the developers at Ubisoft for trying to do new and original things in this sequel - one that comes only a year after its predecessor - it seems that the Rayman Raving Rabbids idea just isn't quite good enough for a real franchise.,
"There are some issues with the controls, much of the gesture gameplay is gratuitous, and the game offers all the perplexity of a chemistry set. But folks looking to role play as mayor might consider SimCity Creator as a rental.",
"Knytt Underground looks for players with an artistic sensitivity, inviting them to surrender to its inspired environments. It is not meant to challenge your thumbs, it does not want to be a source of stress. Instead, it wants to convey a feeling of relax and adventure, counting on a solid and pleasantly retro gameplay that becomes a call to explore its huge and stunning underground world.",
"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension lacks the variety to sustain its 10-or-so hours of length, and the imagination to truly make good on its multiple-worlds concept. The experience is serviceable enough, but it won't inspire you the way that the best superhero games can.",
"As an overall package, Ever Forward is a solid enough puzzle game with enough eureka moments for puzzle fans to want to get involved. It's unfortunately let down by its more action-based moments and its up-and-down difficulty curve, which stops it from being a must-play. Nonetheless, there's still a fair amount to love for those after a punchy and short puzzle game.",
"Majora's Mask 3D is the most powerful and thorough remastering we've played in the Zelda franchise. Each corner of Termina has been revamped with an unusual sense of thoughtfulness and love to its fans. Finally, the wait was worth it.",
"Don't come in expecting anything groundbreaking or technically refined, but if you've been harboring a grudge against the cute platform creatures of the world, you may want to check out Raze's Hell to satiate those urges.",
"Track Lab combines making music and solving puzzles into a very unique and entertaining title with excellent controls and lovely tunes which are sure to relax anybody. The amount of puzzles is somewhat limited and making music (in a separate game mode) is where the meat of Track Lab lies. Although you can spend hours and hours in this mode, you can't share any of your creations with anybody else oddly enough.",
The final problem that really kills the title is its length and lack of replay value. There are only 10 stages plus the final boss which only take you about 40 minutes to plow through.,
"To be sure, you could critique Biomotor Unitron for not straying too far from its inspiration – and even if it borrows from Pokémon, it never comes close to matching it. But just as the ‘90s had room for second-tier competitors like Digimon, there’s no reason why Biomotor Unitron can’t exist as a fun curio today. It won’t make anyone forget Pokémon or wonder why Biomotor Unitron didn’t find more of a fanbase, but it’s fun enough that you’ll be able to enjoy it anyway.",
"If Iro Hero was updated to create a better balance, I would definitely want to play it again. The game has a lot of potential. There are great bosses with different fighting styles, the graphics are fun and non-distracting from the gameplay, and the music and sound effects all add to the overall action. However, throwing endless enemies and obstacles at a player all in the name of creating a difficult game does not inherently produce a rewarding challenge. Unfortunately this title sorely missed that mark.",
"We didn't expect much from Beyond Eyes and the short two hours we needed to complete the game proved us right. From an artistic point of view, the game is quite seducing but there are so few things to do there that it quickly becomes boring.",
"The abundance of dinosaurs and the city-building aspect of Jurassic World Evolution is excellent. It’s like creating a lawless piece of land where your guests can wander aimlessly while you continue to neglect their needs for a restroom and instead build gift shops that make 500% profit. A fun and challenging enough simulator where your creations can eat people, both new and old fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will find this game very enjoyable.",
"We were hoping for a passionate display of Square's rekindling love for the RPG craft. Instead, Sword of Mana hangs around its competitors in relative mediocrity instead of blazing the trail the SNES title did all those years ago. [Feb 2004, p.109]",
"If you are a fan of the arcade or not, doesn't care. Time Crisis: Razing Storm is a badly bundled collection. Aiming and shooting with the Move is simple and fun, but the three arcade titles would have been better if the game wasn't so permissive. The FPS mode in Razing Storm hasn't learned anything from the best shooters on the Wii, offering a slow, uncomfortable and very much rough combat system.",
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos is a beautiful application of a roguelike system with a 2D dungeon crawler format married perfectly to a town-building system and overworld that invites exploration and grinding gems to uncover more things to do outside of combat. This is a no-brainer for classic Zelda fans or anyone looking for co-op fun, and it’s absolutely been the best gaming experience so far for me in 2021.",
"Unquestionably, Go Mecha Ball action is intense, as you shoot and smash your way across ramps and quarter-pipes. While the inclusion of roguelike power-up attempt to inject some variety, it’s not quite enough to keep this ball rolling for too long.",
Playing Myst V was one of the saddest moments in my life. This game is nothing but a prolonged agony. Each puzzle you solve is one more step towards the end. The Myst universe is one of the most beautiful manifestations of human imagination.,
"Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death sounds like a straight to VHS (DVD or Blu-Ray for the kiddies) action movie starring a washed up 80s action star *cough* Carl Weathers *cough*. But this doesn’t make it any less fun. In fact for anyone searching for a quick God of War-type fix, I can’t recommend it enough. I had fun from beginning to end, and the cheese was just the right amount of thick.",
"Knights and Bikes captures the heart of childhood imagination. It’s a largely carefree experience with limited mechanical substance, but that's part of the reason it works. It’s a great family-friendly co-op game and balances its silly sense of humour and childlike joy with some of the melancholic reality of growing up.",
"The only good that this game serves is that it keeps Fuzion Frenzy’s legacy of being synonymous with “bad game” alive for another generation. Even if Microsoft offers it as a five dollar download on Xbox Live Arcade, pass on it – unless, of course, you collect Worst Games of the Year.",
"It's primarily a multiplayer experience, but what's here is also just different enough to really stand out -- and better still to give the Warriors franchise a breath of fresh air.",
"Despite a bit of a misstep regarding space battles, I have very little to complain about when it comes to Endless Space 2. Any bugs or other technical frustrations I had in the Early Access have disappeared with the full release, which also includes a whole new Faction that I can’t wait to play.",
"If there is a knock against Forza Motorsports it's that the game does not have much personality. The racing is great and the cars look sweet, but there's not much going on in between.",
"This remains a game with an awful lot of potential, but not much execution. It's still glitchy - this review doesn't cover more than a fraction of the issues I've seen - but underneath it all is a set of baseball ideas and mechanics that could easily produce a fantastic game in the future.",
"The game doesn't bring anything new to the this genre, but its rock-solid design and succulent visuals should be more than enough to satisfy Dragon Ball fans that are looking for some on-the-go butt-kicking.",
"Quarrel is still the horribly compelling single-player game it's always been on mobiles, with an extra dollop of polish and a few new tantalising game modes for the console release - and all for the laughable sum of 400 Microsoft Points.",
"Quantum of Solace is another great game from Vicarious Visions that not only exceeds its console cousin, it actually enhances the secret agent experience with some clever touch-based gameplay that makes the most of the DS system.",
"Warhammer 40.000: Kill Team is brain off, guns out. The ""Orc slicing"" is fun especially at the beginning but is more and more running out of air the further you get. Warhammer fans may consider a buy everyone else should probably keep his/her axe at home considering a 800 MS Points price point.",
"Hell Yeah! The wrath of the dead rabbit is a title that strives to be unique, but it does so only in part. The style of the game is definitely catchy, thanks to the irresistible humor and the great audiovisual impact. But if you delete these purely formal aspects, it turns out to be a platform with obvious shortcomings.",
"The improvements -- the tackling, the animations, the authenticity in general -- work together to make this one of the best football titles ever created. There’s no reason not to own this thing if you’re looking for a videogame that recreates the NFL experience in a fun, immersive, and competitive way.",
"A great combination of genres that manages to really tax your brain, be great fun and work as a competitive and addictive multiplayer game. Not so great for solo players, though. [Issue#83, p.104]",
"The enemy AI seems to be a mixture of wunderbar and dumkopf - they frequently rumble you when you're convinced you're well concealed, yet sometimes you can swing a punch at them from one foot away and they totally ignore you.",
A splendid dancing game although the new hit songs mostly suck and some the other songs have been recycled over and over again. Plus there are not that many new ideas compared to Unleashed 2. [Apr 2006],
"The Thaumaturge remains quite special overall. Hanging out with Rasputin, shmoozing with turn-of-the-century elites, and exploring some unexpected golem developments with beset Rabbis make for compelling content, even when a few lines in the script fail to land. Anyone taken in by this setting will genuinely want to play The Thaumaturge, and it joins several other recent experimental Slavic fantasy adventures that prove the countless avenues video games have yet to fully explore.",
"Enjoying Hotline Miami doesn't make you a worse person, though you may find yourself wrestling with just why the act of deftly delivered murder is so damn much fun. It is because it's a lovingly crafted game, well-designed and deeply addictive.",
"Mistwalker once again delivers an interesting and deep role-playing game that also manages to innovate the RPG-genre in some aspects. A convincing story, combined with a unique combat system and a great audiovisual presentation, makes The Last Story a must-have game for anyone who has a special place in their heart for special RPG's.",
"Samorost 3 is a sensational journey through a delightful yet deceptively twisted world where fairytale collides with science fiction, themes of addiction and power mix with lighthearted play, and the adventures of a little the gnome always kept a smile on my face.",
"There's not enough of an RPG foundation to keep RPG purists' attention, there's not enough action to appeal to the mainstream gamer, and the linear feel of the game will leave most gamers feeling trapped (though there are sidequests here and there).",
"Rollerdrome surprises by offering an interesting combination of skating with shooting. The gameplay is extremely smooth and this makes it quite addictive. Due to the many challenges, the game also has a good replay value, which means you can get away with it for a long time. Add to that a tight presentation and Rollerdrome is highly recommended. Keep in mind that there are some minor issues that can be irritating, but it is so minimal that you can still get enough enjoyment out of it.",
"Milestone’s first steps into the new generation of virtual supercross entertain with an engaging, mostly well-executed, and fun package, though it’s quite challenging at first, and not without flaws. The supporting features in career mode don’t really stand out, and we wouldn’t have minded a few more changing elements to spice things up. The physics engine still needs some tweaking, and performance isn’t as stable as we’d like. That said, a couple of patches could easily fix these issues, and the upcoming new contents promised by the developers should help flesh out a currently underwhelming baseline. If you enjoyed previous entries, the technical improvements and the new sights offered by the updated roster and online championships might push you to try this new episode, while motorcycle enthusiasts could find a new passion in Monster Energy Supercross 25.",
"If I could give Beyond Eyes more stars, I would. Rarely does a character emotion become so pronounced in my own being. When Rae was delighted, I’d laugh with excitement. When Rae was scared, I cowered alongside her. When Rae was upset I was quite literally found sobbing in the fetal position until the wave of emotion passed.",
"There's a lot of interesting fodder here, but at this point, Dark Energy would be better off running with a clean slate instead of essentially patching and re-patching this one. If you are curious and can tolerate the low points, give it a run. But if you have already stepped into Kate's shoes on XBLA, there's no need to lace them up again.",
"Featuring tight racing controls, 12 wacky drivers encapsulated in 12 real-life vehicles, and fast-paced, addictive, and challenging racing, Racing Gears Advance is simply a great game in every respect.",
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a beautiful canvas that needs more detail to make it a masterpiece. Gemea is an enchanting location and the majority of systems in the game function well, but the magic hook is missing. The story isn’t engrossing and the quests just blend into each other for the most part, as do the characters that give them. Gemea is magical, the content not so much.",
"Everspace is a massive space shooter with roguelike mechanics and permadeath. It perfectly balances fighting, exploration and crafting, giving an extremely fun and satisfying experience. Every run is different from the previous one and you can discover something new every time, weird ways to die included.",
"If you’re wanting to pick up an accessible space shooter that you can casually play but has a great deal of depth, Everspace comes more than highly recommended. It’s a game that will have you hooked no matter your skill level.",
"Wilson's Heart is a visually-stunning adventure offering a host of expertly-crafted immersive environments, complete with realistic characters and competent voice acting. A thin sheen of '40s campiness coats what turns out to be a horrifying and surreal nightmare world. While puzzles are interesting and varied, the game disappointingly suffers from inconsistent object interaction and lack-luster monster battles. [Tested with Oculus Touch]",
"The core gameplay is involving and well executed, and bolstered by a great camera, solid controls and an intuitive interface. However, the sequel lacks any decisively outstanding or revolutionary features that truly invest the player in the storyline.",
"Despite the dated graphics, Criminal Girls: Invite Only manages to impress as an entirely competent retro dungeon crawler. It does run out of steam before the end with some amazingly pointless backtracking and a storyline that devolves into a typical harem snoozefest, but the overall experience? Still worth it, overall.",
"When it clicks, the game is second-to-none which is why I’ll continue to play despite its many issues. With no campaign, spotty multiplayer, and poor canned scenarios, Arma III just isn’t a complete product at this time.",
Even though Full Metal Alchemist 2: Akaki Elixir no Akuma is more of the same it has some improvements over the original. If you loved the original title or the anime than the sequel should please you. Otherwise you probably want to try before you buy because Full Metal Alchemist 2 isn't a hallmark action RPG.,
"Developer Fool’s Theory has crafted a pretty solid turn-based RPG with The Thaumaturge. Its setting in 1905 Warsaw is fairly novel in games and at times, can feel like an intriguing, immersive documentary that educates its players on the harsh conditions during this time in history. The supernatural powers at protagonist Wiktor Szulski’s disposal pave the way to a satisfying battle system that carves out its own identity, despite looking like something out of Shin Megami Tensei or Persona upon first glance. There are technical rough edges here and there, but I firmly believe that RPG fans should definitely check out The Thaumaturge whenever they find time in this busy year of RPGs in 2024.",
"Concord is an incredibly distinct PvP shooter in an incredibly busy space. Tight, polished gameplay drives its diverse cast along a number of memorable maps. Distinctly old-school in its execution, it is multiplayer game stripped of annoyance and packed with fun.",
"This feels like a B-game. This Resident Evil feels cheap because of the recycling of animations, enemies and locations throughout the four episodes. The coop-experience however, is pretty nice because of the combination of different characters. We also love the way Resi is becoming a bit more creepy again.",
Immersive elements are everywhere: You don't just press a button to activate a lever that opens a gate -- you use the analog stick to shift Harry in the direction you want to tug that lever.,
"Sadly, beneath the awful looking exterior, the gameplay on Xbox is mixed at best. The poor framerate doesn't help any, the stiff controls are only worsened, and pretty much everything about the PC version is either watered down, ruined, or lost altogether.",
Journey of a Roach is ideal for someone who wants a change of pace in a puzzle game. It is for someone who does not want a complex story line and is looking for an affordable puzzle game for your PC.,
"Staking its claim in the under populated wilderness betwixt classic story-driven RPG and balls-to-the-wall splatter action, it's a worthy evolution of a still-fresh franchise and a rather impressive addition to the PSP line up in its own right.",
"There's plenty of fun to be had with the online mode, and it&#146;s often fun just cruising around the cities looking for every shortcut and also trying to find the locked cars the game has to offer, making it well worth a purchase.",
"If the competition is Gran Turismo, there's no contest here. The complete integration of online play, full vehicle customization, better racing AI, and many other features raise Forza above the pack.",
Sonic Colors is a fantastic game. Its greatest achievement is that one does not have to be a super-tolerant dyed-in-the-wool Sonic super fan to enjoy it or to forgive a laundry list of flaws.,
"Minis on the Move is a thoughtfully constructed puzzle game, built around an appealingly simple premise that then gets reexamined and evolved in multiple ingenious ways. More than that, it shows Nintendo adapting to changes in the online and mobile market that suggest the best is yet to come.",
"Sin Episodes: Emergence feels and plays like theater food. It’s a quick rush once you chow down, but as soon as the sugar starts digesting you start noticing things you’ve seen before.",
"Its a shame that Party Classics doesn't really bring much new with it, it seems to be nothing more than an add-on for the franchise with another Lips game coming very shortly, will iNiS bring us a completely new game or will everything be nothing more than an add-on.",
"Starship Troopers: Extermination feels bare bones, buggy (pun intended), and frankly unfinished. While the game has nostalgic visuals for the fans of the Starship Troopers franchise, this reviewer feels like it doesn’t have much else to offer.",
"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation was a good game for PlayStation Vita. The developers did a great job adapting the original gameplay to the portable nature of the Sony's console. If played on a TV, the game loses its original virtues, turning it into a boring experience.",
"Hellbound is a fun shooter that’s got all the hallmarks of what made the 90s FPS genre so great. Unfortunately, just like the 90s games before it, it’s pretty dated in both optimization and graphics. There’s a large number of bugs and game-breaking glitches to be experienced, all of which tarnish what is otherwise an incredible experience.",
"The Urbz feels like a step back for the franchise; despite EA's efforts to bring gamers a 'console exclusive' there's not a lot on offer here. Fans won't find anything new, but newcomers may well discover the pleasure of the series and seek out EA's back catalogue of simulated lifestyles. [Christmas 2004, p.114]",
"It is difficult to criticise a game, however, when it delivers a shedload of genuinely taxing levels at such a great value price point. It looks terrific, with sharp, bright environments that make plotting the trajectory of your cube easy on the eye.",
"If you don't run afoul of the game's technical and server-related issues, you'll find Diablo II: Resurrected to be a good version of the classic action RPG. For those who have played with the 2000 PC classic countless times, this is a like-for-like copy of that title, only with a few more accessibility options and a new lick of paint so it blends in with modern releases. For those who are new to the game or are more familiar with Diablo III, keyboard and mouse players will feel limited, while the lack of modern quality-of-life amenities can dampen the excitement for the title. Either way, once everything clears up, Diablo II can become a great addition to any ARPG library, and if you're one who pays attention to the review score, you can bump up the number when the fixes roll in.",
"Every remark, battle cry and slash looks, sounds, and feels authentic to these characters, especially Wolverine and Sabertooth. This game will definitely put you in the spandex of your favorite spandex slasher, which by the way is not the manliest of looks.",
"Valkyria Revolution is an experiment, more similar to a musou than to all of its predecessors, and this won't resonate with the majority of the fans of the franchise. But, taken for what it is, it's still a decent action game with light RPG and strategic elements.",
A title that will please both the traditional players and the new players. The story is really addictive and entertaining thanks to the variety of scenarios and creatures. Fun gameplay and an excellent artistic section.,
"Overall, I started the game with a bit of skepticism since I was only familiar with it’s turn based system which I quite enjoyed for the setting it was in, as it presented you with time to think and was more of an RTS, tactical kind of approach which I enjoyed greatly. At first it was a little odd to adjust to, but the faster pace gameplay fits the setting better than a turn based system would with all the options for combat they’ve put in and it actually gets quite addicting to play the different class roles, I miss the old play style, but I can enjoy both quite easily so I don’t feel I’m losing out. The games’ value is great too at $59.95 upon release, I’m actually quite pleased it’s not more, it’s around the average price for this kind of game, but in a world where a lot of games are $80+ for base editions and $100+ for special editions it’s a welcome bracket to fit into.",
"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate is the ultimate version of Dead or Alive 5 (to date), but its additions serve more to please existing Team Ninja fanatics than to make the game more appealing to a general audience.",
"Throne and Liberty would undoubtedly have required a few more months of development to correct the many bugs that plague new players. The universe is clean, the interface and icons are neat, progression is sound and the gameplay is fluid and dynamic. Of course, Throne and Liberty won't be able to compete with the premium tenors of the MMO genre any time soon. But it's got everything it takes to make its mark, with a dynamic open world at its heart, which requires you to exist within it, rather than serve as a dumb launching pad for leveling.",
"Plenty of changes that mostly scratch the surface, while the new classic mode is just a temporary distraction. More of a warmup before the full round of next-gen racing. [Nov 2013]",
"The Thaumaturge is a game of undeniable cultural value, and the opportunity to explore early 20th century Warsaw (realistic, but enriched with fantastic elements) alone made it worth my time. I wish I could tell you that the rest of the game – the story, the mechanics – is on par with the unique setting, but sadly, that’s not the case, as we’ve already seen all of it done much better elsewhere.",
"The game has a lot going for it when everything is working properly and the handful of new gameplay elements turns Riptide into something legitimately better than its predecessor. In some ways, Dead Island: Riptide feels like a massive content patch, but considering its smarter pacing and greater visual and gameplay variety, it's closer to what the original game probably should have been.",
"If you loved Tony Hawk, you will definitely love Mat Hofman's Pro BMX. While it doesn't have the more extensive options and deeper mechanics of ""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,"" it has plenty of its own personality and depth.",
"The Namco Museum successfully ports these classic games onto a modern console that allows both new and veteran gamers the chance to experience these historic titles or relive them again. With a total of ten games available on Namco Museum, it gives players a wide assortment of titles, all with their own unique gaming mechanics to play for countless hours which is like having your own virtual arcade. What I really enjoyed about this collection was the ability to play the games in their purest form which is ideal if you’re waiting because they allow for quick or long bursts.",
"Sine Mora EX builds upon the original game by offering some truly innovative multiplayer aspects. Besides that, the shooting action is as stellar as ever so if you've never played the original then this is definitely a shmup that you need to check out.",
"I haven't had a game eat away at me like this for a long time...For the amount of gameplay in the game, and the breadth of it, I would definitely say that it is worth every cent of the purchase price.",
"The developers have nailed the sense of progression and the tension that the genre is built around. The presentation is very old-school, which can be a problem for players who have never interacted with MS-DOS titles. It is also integral to the spirit of this game. Loop Hero is a great game for fans of its genre and has plenty of cool mechanics and hooks for those who want to try it out for the first time.",
"The Sojourn is a beautiful game with numerous extremely clever puzzles but it has a hard time balancing its story and difficulty curve. I honestly wish I liked this game more than I did. It has a lot going for it, but if I hadn’t been reviewing it, I would not have made it to the end. Though seemingly inspired by some of the best games ever, The Sojourn falters in its ambition. On the other hand, if you like first-person puzzle games and want to stare at something incredibly pretty for a while, you could do a lot worse than The Sojourn.",
"Excellent visuals, innovative racing features and accessibility to drivers of all skill levels make this title stand out from its competition, including games with more tracks and vehicles.",
"Everspace is an intriguing and fresh roguelike enriched by a touch of space opera and stunning graphics. Not so balanced for the first hours, it gets gradually better thanks to the permanent upgrades system.",
"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron doesn't come close to recapturing the magic of fighting Autobots and Decepticons in the bedrooms and playgrounds of our youths, but High Moon Studios has created something that allows us to fondly recall those bygone times.",
Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition is an excellent port that invites us to play and that manages to make us forget even its low resolution in handheld mode. A must-see experience for lovers of management games and scientifically incorrect dinosaurs.,
"Pro mode is something new in a genre in a desperate need of innovation. Maybe it won't be able to teach you how to play music, but it's the nearest thing in videogame industry. Unfortunately, if you already are a musician, you will find yourself a bit frustrated by the rigidity of the system. Also, the keyboard hasn't been fully supported with a lacking tracklist and a limited peripheral.",
"Unfortunately while Monochroma's story manages some delicate moments, its gameplay can't escape obscene points of needless frustration and mechanical tedium. It’s the latter that comes to define the experience.",
"Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition will in all likelihood be a visual novel that I will remember for a very long time. Not only is it successful in the normal ways that a VN should be, but it goes above and beyond in its ability to tell a story thanks to a skillful blend of narrative genres and a creative decision-making mechanic which, while not perfect, is still very fun to play with. Whether or not you played the game when it originally released on Steam, any VN fan worth their salt would do well to pick up this wonderful (and horrifying) title.",
"Life is Strange got off to a so-so start, but strong storytelling and impressive choice and consequence mechanics boost its first season. Soon the world really gets its hooks in, and you'll enjoy it despite yourself.",
"A decent DLC, that offers a new character whose combo potential and gameplay is as spectacular as that of the main protagonist. Pity it's a bit too short, and doesn't really offer any original content.",
"Inside Edge is the most significant addition to the game, and we hope to see scouting play a part in the genre in the future. But control problems with baserunning and fielding, along with a lack of general polish, keep 2K6 from being the great game it's trying to be.",
"The game has virtually no replay value meaning you won’t be coming back to this often, unless you finally do find someone to play co-op with. Nevertheless it is one of the better games on Live Arcade.",
"Make no mistake: Reality Fighters is a reasonably impressive technical showpiece first and foremost. The game, which is unfortunately the main draw and the main reason to buy the thing, is an afterthought. And a pretty poor one at that.",
"The Last Story is not the last classic japanese RPG, as it diverges deeply from the tradition of the genre, lacking some of its core elements and borrowing something from others. It tells a marvellous story, through solid gameplay which shines in the versatility of the combat system. We're well aware it may not be what fans have been asking, but if you'll give it some attention, you will be carried away.",
"We're huge fans of the genre, and really buy into the thought of regular episodic content, but we'd demand it at a significantly reduced price and with an approach that actually panders to the long-term fans of this style of game - as opposed to young kids with no patience.",
"Lock's Quest is everything a portable strategy game should be. Its battles are exciting little bursts of bite-sized panic attacks, lasting only minutes at a time, but feeling much longer. Despite a few niggles, the stylus controls work pretty damn well, helped by the clean and simple methods of control used. It's just a really, really, really good portable game.",
"I will say that I have spent enough time on this game to encompass my two playthroughs of Mass Effect, or both of the Knights of the Old Republic titles. And I can honestly say that, in comparison, I didn’t enjoy one minute of it. Good-day.",
"At the end of the day, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance's greatest accomplishment is that that it assures the world that Platinum's bag of tricks is deeper than anyone thought. This game provides a fresh take on the stylish/character action genre, and it comes off as a high-tier entry in the Metal Gear series.",
"If you've never had the fortune of playing Guardian Heroes before, HD is an essential purchase. Treasure has a spotless record and this long forgotten beat 'em up is easily one of their crowning achievements.",
"An overall great sequel to the original, color-splashing action shooter. Minor improvements to the Hero mode might not be enough for veteran players, but with the multiplayer component of the game being better than ever, Splatoon 2 can easily guarantee hours and hours of co-op paintball action.",
"Although I suppose that Super Princess Peach is an example of Nintendo slumming for cash, it also proves that even when Nintendo is slumming, it churns out stuff that isn't really that bad. It may not be memorable or very exciting, but it's not bad.",
"A good player can wrap this game up in just under three hours, which definitely makes it a tough sell to all but the hardcore fans. But for fans, the experience is short and oh-so sweet, and the unlockable content -- additional characters like Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Super Saiyan Vegeta -- is sure to make it worthwhile.",
"The controls are great once you get them customized properly*fire buttons on L1 and R1), with nimble movement and crazy bursts of speed seldom seen outside of anime, but this dexterity is wasted on short missions, bare-bones multiplayer, and the same ol' gameplay AC has been recycling for years. [Apr 2007, p.85]",
"I can understand why someone would be a little hesitant to try a game that leaves its movement and battles completely hands-off – personally, I prefer to actively play games than to passively watch them. Don’t let the idle aspects of the game fool you, though. There’s a surprising amount of depth and strategy to the game that goes well beyond what you’d expect from it. Loop Hero is the kind of game that will have you telling yourself that you’ll play “just one more loop” while the clock hands make a surprising number of circuits of their own.",
"With the additional playtime, Age of Wonders IV still impressed me even though I am concerned about the AI. The other issues I have brought up are all easily fixed over time, if not on day one. Between the customization options, atmosphere, and Pantheon system, Paradox Interactive and developer Triumph Studios have a great start to the next entry in the Age of Wonders series. I can’t wait to see how they expand the spells and Pantheon systems further, for fans of fantasy 4x strategy games, Age of Wonders IV is worth checking out if you want to evoke that old feeling of needing to take just one more turn.",
"Still the best competitive Karaoke franchise on the market, this latest version fails to impress with a lack of game modes, mobile app connection issues and the inability to download all the tunes you want on PS4, or transfer some of them from older versions of the game.",
Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games is less interesting than the previous games of this franchise released for Nintendo Wii. The lack of gameplay features designed around the Wii U GamePad is a big mistake from SEGA's developers. If you're looking for a good party game for Nintendo Wii U just buy the more interesting Wii Party U and have fun.,
"Namco Museum for the Switch is a great attempt at a collection of classic arcade games. Fighting to become the top score on the leaderboard is fun, even if the other challenges often come off as shallow. With the detailed manuals and the great display options, adding a few more games, or even more challenges could have made this the definitive Namco Museum.",
There's no real reason to buy the PlayStation Vita version of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as the touch-screen controls are both simple and repetitive. The home console editions are both better and cheaper.,
"More importantly, each character has left a lasting impression on me and the growth that they experienced during the story makes the game feel even closer to the timeless stories of early RPGs. Legrand Legacy: Tale of the Fatebounds expertly brings the PlayStation era RPGs to 2018 with an attention to detail that brings the genre to modern consoles and satisfies that nostalgic itch.",
"Th3 Plan is pretty good for a budget game, even with its poor graphics and clichéd and unimaginative story. If you can ignore the incredibly stupid foes and convince yourself that the tasks you're completing are worthy of a team of super thieves, then you might be able to enjoy Th3 Plan.",
"Ghost Song doesn’t try to reinvent the Metroidvania genre, but neither does it clutter it up with extra mechanics for the sake of complexity. It’s approachable but challenging. What it lacks in originality is made up for by attractive art, good level design and overall, addictive fun.",
"I can certainly appreciate the value of seeing where video games got their start, but we have come so far that nostalgia and preservation are really the only selling points of this collection.",
"But tie the high-brow nature of the cockpit-nerd content with the disconnected, unhelpful interface, and what comes up for the rest of us is a recognizable flight sim that&#146;s very firmly grounded.",
"It was a joy to visit Part Time UFO again outside of a smart phone. Being on Switch gives the game new life, and it’s more enjoyable than ever. Thanks to its varied levels and its ridiculously cute characters, you’ll come back to it again and again. Just don’t expect too much from its multiplayer mode.",
"This is what Suda51 fans want. It's fresh, unique and very, very fun, even though we think it could have used some extra weeks of development to erase that feeling of being a little bit rushed, and become a better game.",
"Even though the game is unchanged, the personality, the simple style of play and the blowing up demons into a pixilated bloody mess, plus the new episode make this game worth a purchase even though the multiplayer suffers from that inexcusable lag.",
"Atlus somehow finds a way to craft a music game based around Persona 4 and have it end up as a serious entry to the rhythm genre. Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a great experience, with gameplay, visual, and a soundtrack that all come together in one heck of a package.",
"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron won't likely garner many Game of the Year awards since it just slightly misses the mark on a few key points, but what it does bring is some serious passion for a great property. What's important this time around is that Activision allowed High Moon to see that through with a big budget and the time needed to polish things up.",
"South of Midnight has razor-sharp controls and a stunningly unique audio/visual presentation that stands out as one of the most memorable in gaming this year, despite having some predictable combat and exploration.",
"At least the audio captures a bit of the enjoyably cornball feel of the film. The bugs and guns don't make much of an impression, but troops utter intentionally cheesy lines like, ""I'm so bad I scare myself!""",
"A solid remaster with improved graphics and mostly great gameplay. The controls aren't always mapped handily, but the gameplay remains solid. The many references to the original Pac-Man are great, but the frequent need to backtrack is not. The levels are well designed while the bosses have a lot of variety. The game isn't very long, thich means it doesn't overstay it's welcome.",
"The fact that the game is short, the graphics not up to par and the levels somewhat repetitive will likely keep this game out of the hands of mainstream gamers despite it's twenty dollar price.",
"Vermintide is the best kind of game, then; the kind where whimsy dictates the events, but personal skill influences the outcome. Looking at the overwhelming number of my Steam friends that are currently playing, I can see already that Vermintide will quickly become the next title that everyone’s friends will be playing.",
"Aporia tells a story through environments. It's a game like Myst, that feeds on the urge of wanting to explore, find and search. A good idea, but it does not seem totally finished, which spoils the experience a bit.",
"Although there is some excellent work put in by Catwoman and John Doe, Fractured Mask is ultimately just a series of ""Choose A or B"" conversations, taking place in overly-familiar locales, with stakes not quite as high as the game would have you believe.",
"South of Midnight proves that even simple pieces of fabric can be woven into something beautiful. What may seem like a straightforward game with unremarkable gameplay unfolds into a unique experience, offering a little something for everyone—whether it’s satisfying parkour, engaging combat, or simply exploring a breathtaking, magical world.",
"Mugen Souls offers the typical JRPG look with matching music. Nevertheless the graphics aren't overwhelming and although the synchronization is great, even if there is no german version, there are just too much dialogues in the game. The turn-based gameplay provides tactical depth and the innumerable attacks and the Moe-Kill offer more variety during combat.",
"The polemic side of the game is going to capture the headlines, there's a good RPG behind it. The motivation system is indeed original, but is also abused and this eventually prevents it from feeling as a relevant addition.",
"Neon White achieves everything it sets out to with remarkable success. Not only is it one of the most entertaining experiences I've played in years, but it also speaks to a highly specific audience many just don't anymore. It's for weirdos, misfits, and dorks. Neon White is one of the best games of the year, and it'd be a colossal mistake not to check it out...If you're able, we highly recommend playing on PC – particularly with a mouse.",
"Minor issues aside, Denki has created a wonderful, addictive game that I'm sure I'll be returning to throughout the year. Whether you're a dictionary-reading diehard or an armchair general, Quarrel has enough depth and charm to keep most gamers smiling.",
"There's that fetish element that seems like a luring detail, shining on the box to raise debate and stir appetites. If you look deep enough, though, you'll find a dungeon crawler worthy of some of your time and attention.",
"A very nice expansion pack for a very mediocre game. The additions are numerous and well designed, and they give you a lot of new options while playing the game, but they don’t really change how the game is played.",
"If you like board games and have friends with whom you share an unshakeable friendship, you should consider buying this game. Although it features some almost impossible challenges against the AI, it has hours of fun deciding which strategies you should use that are enough reason to be a highly worthy game.",
"Looks can be deceiving, and from an outsider’s point of view, Metrico+ could be seen as bland and basic. That couldn’t be further than the truth, as it is in fact engaging, very clever and creates a sense of melancholy to balance out any moments of minor frustration.",
"A Total War Saga: Troy absolutely nails its Bronze Age setting and comes up with interesting ways to make the period work in its grand strategy framework, but its AI has trouble wrapping its head around it.",
"RPG Maker Fes got on my nerves at times, but I was still completely enamored by it. The touch screen controls work perfectly and the game even has a predictive keyboard to help as you're typing up dialogue. Between being able to make your RPG in chunks on the go and having such a wonderfully user-friendly UI, Fes makes the creation process easy—it's the process of executing these creations that it doesn't make simple. If you're prepared to dedicate yourself to your RPG and have the patience to learn Fes's intimidating mechanics, you'll find that it's a fun piece of software that will help you bring your creations to life.",
"It carries you over to a drab, sad place and tells a story that doesn’t make sense. Maybe it would be best – both for Ubisoft and players – to just forget about Unity? [03/2014, p.72]",
"One of the more famous games of all time comes to today standards thanks to Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade; even if you don’t know this game and you don’t like 80’s games, you must try Outrun Online Arcade, because it’s a funny and frustration-free title.",
"After Us from developer Piccolo is an interesting title. It tries to create a Journey-like inspiring adventure through gigantic worlds and simplistic controls. Most of what it does works well, especially with its narrative, though the mechanics from its gameplay design sometimes fight against story progression and player engagement. The game can create some frustration with the camera and controls but wins more than it loses.",
"For some people, the bottom line will be this -- is Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the Vita a faithful port of the console version? To that question, we would say, ""Yes."" It looks and plays more or less identically to the original game, and it has all of the relevant DLC as well. For those of you who need a Marvel vs. Capcom 3 fix wherever you happen to be, this game is pretty much everything you could hope for.",
"A beautiful and wonderful surprise, South of Midnight is a delightful fantasy adventure title that crafts a uniquely southern story about connection and rebuilding harmony in a way that’s rare in videogames today. Hazel and the cast of characters are pleasant, the powers and abilities Hazel uses are plentiful and pleasing, the world is rich with engrossing natural environments, and the breeziness inherent within the game’s storytelling and accessibility makes it a stunning experience. The repetition does grate, and scrapping against haints could use more sparkle and empowerment, but otherwise South of Midnight is one of the best games this year and thoroughly deserves your attention.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan from developer Neople is a different and more accessible take on the action role-playing game Souls blueprint. It’s difficult most of the time but brings a good story, great enemies, and a hefty and well-executed backend system. While mostly a great game, its downside is that it is a linear journey that will test a gamer’s frustration limits.",
"Don't come looking for 'answers' from the first game, or everything to be wrapped up in a nice present either. Come for what Alan Wake does best; entrap you into a world of fear and unknowing with brilliant writing and narrative.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is an interesting (and more importantly, fun) new edition of the EA Sports football saga, with many small tweaks to the pre-existing game modes and two big new features, Rush and FC IQ. In both cases, it can be said that the target was hit, and that the overall quality stands at very good levels. A few bugs and glitches in the menus do not affect a more than enjoyable gaming ex-perience, which promises to keep fans busy for a long time with careers, multiplayer challenges and trading cards...",
"The Toy-Con 01 is a good fun for parents who want to share some playing time with theirs kids. But even though the building part of the game is fun, the fun itself evaporated quickly when it comes to actually playing.",
"Hellbound has really good movement and the texture quality looks nice, but it's insanely short, the level design is mediocre, and there's nothing here that FPS fans haven't seen done better for decades.",
"All in all the Vergil’s Downfall, the first DLC for Devil May Cry, is a solid experience as Vergil’s unique combos are fun and the narrative is actually pretty good, all which make the $7.99 (720 MS Points) worth the price of admission. The collectibles and additional difficulties deliver a fair amount of content for the coin too.",
"Fans of strategy games and those looking for something a little different would be interested in the title. For beginners, there is a bit of a learning curve to get through and with an adjustable difficulty setting, you can easily take things slow. I just wish certain aspects of the game were explained a bit better.",
"Shadow run is a campy romp that doesn't take itself too seriously. Its fun to play through, but only mimics (and doesn't quite stack up to) the exceedingly excellent XCOM. There is better weapon class variety, character customization, and a few other points where it might exceed its muse, but it measures up just a shade below on most other occasions.",
"My biggest complaints with Kill Team are the length – it's needs to be about twice as long, and the local-only co-op mode that doesn't allowed the second player to log in with their gamer profile. This means that only the primary player earns achievements. Despite these two glaring flaws, Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a total blast for as long as it lasts, and one of the best co-op experiences I've had on XBLA ever.",
"A nostalgic-fuelled, absolute blast. It's wonderful to finally be able to play this once again, and it's far too long coming - better on the Switch, as the ability to play it on the go adds even more to this release. Ultimately, though, after waiting 18 years, this isn't enough. This deserved more of a remaster with more extras, perhaps even a remastered trilogy. Hopefully, more is coming. Hopefully, fans will show Capcom that this is what they want. With Onimusha: Warlords reminding fans of the glory days and Resident Evil 2 one of the finest games of the generation, the audience is still there. Now bring on Dino Crisis, more Onimusha, Resident Evil 3 and everything else you've got Capcom!",
"Despite the repetitiveness inherent to the genre, the player is constantly hooked by the depth of the game, filled with subtleties and hidden features. Indeed, Loop Hero encourages him to experiment new approaches in order to gather more and more loot or to confront the four bosses of the game, the latter being no mean feat.",
"After Us is a great adventure that will keep you entertained from the beginning to the very end, and that will also make you think about the consequences of the climatic change. The game is both melancholic as well as incredibly beautiful, and it won't let down players who are looking for a video game with a similar feel to Journey.",
"Even though Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Edition outperforms its latest predecessor -- DDR SuperNova 2 -- by offering a training mode, it still falls short of the traditional DDR standard in terms of song selection, online play and visual flair.",
"Even if you rush through the story you can anticipate spending at least 50 hours to complete it. Rushing through is not as much fun, however, and you should take time to do the extra side quests, hunts, exploration, levelling up, etc.",
"The Silver Case and The 25th Ward are both testament to the talent of one of the most picturesque, brilliant and punk directors of the videogame scene, capable of amalgamating, no one knows how, a series of themes, influences, styles and characters that in the hands of others would have turned into a disaster.",
"The key problem is that just about all the good things about it are lifted straight from the original Homeworld, and there's really not a lot in the ""enhancements"" to this sequel which distinguish themselves above the first game.",
"Across the board, Roki therefore has a cohesion that propels it above most other indie adventure games. This can make or break even the most well-funded of game projects, and the fact that Roki's gameplay, story, and art style all interlink so effortlessly means that it is a joy to play and unravel.",
"A Fisherman’s Tale is a typical puzzle-solving first-person VR experience that stands a cut above with a good-quality gimmick that doesn’t overstay its welcome. It barely stays long enough to finish saying hello, but it has the wit, charm, and novelty to make it worth the single sitting it’s asking for.",
"Biomotor Unitron is one of the best releases in Code Mystics and SNK's Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection lineup because it introduced me to a fun RPG that I hadn't even heard of before. The game itself has a few issues holding it back, but Code Mystics has done a fantastic job as usual, and can't wait to see what game arrives next following Biomotor Unitron and Big Bang Pro Wrestling.",
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms should've been a great beat 'em up that took the Downtown Special: Kunio-kun's Historical Period Drama concept to a Romance of the Three Kingdoms setting, but the lack of gameplay polish holds it back on Nintendo Switch. Hopefully Arc System Works revisits this in the future for another entry.",
Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition proves that it is still one of the best examples this genre has to offer. A new coat of paint and smart gameplay changes brings this classic up to date for a new generation of gamers.,
"South of Midnight is a good experience, and that's it. Nothing memorable about it, and even its positive aspects fall short of the standards many are accustomed to. In an industry constantly striving to be exceptional and driven by the desire to become the next big thing, Compulsion Games rejects any pretense of doing so, and it's admirable that they're taking this path, but at the same time, the lack of ambition leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. South of Midnight isn't bad, but it's hard to think of anything that makes it interesting.",
"From my perspective roguelike is a rather frustrating genre. I find it annoying to lose my progress all the time and don’t get much from the randomness of the procedural generated worlds in most of these games. However, because of my fondness for space shooters, I gave Everspace a chance – and to my surprise, it convinced me.",
"Where other 4X titles lean towards a more utilitarian presentation, Endless Space 2 starts with a great 4X game and layers on good art, great writing, and excellent UI design. There's a wide variety of play in the available factions and a deep political system that underpins the entire thing. The combat disappoints and the AI could use some improvement, but Amplitude is known for its expansions and improvements. What's here is already a 4X class act.",
"2D experts might not find quite enough challenge with Hell Yeah! and there's not the most replay value to be found here. Still, the game is absolutely great looking and lots highly enjoyable, just because of its overall level of insanity and its funny antics.",
"Perennial issues aside, with Thrones of Britannia and now Troy, the spin-off Saga series has proved adept at delivering a kind of Total War that is more focused, flavourful, and even experimental than the mainline series. In the specific case of Troy, it's not always an unmitigated success; for every dose of granular detail that reveals more strategic options there's another element of graininess that obscures. At its best, though, Troy is a pretty epic series of bloody enjoyable battles that is just about as good as the series has delivered.",
"This compilation uses the nostalgia effect to draw money from the hardcore fans of Mortal Kombat. Unlike Street Fighter III: Third Strike Online Edition, anyway, after so many years the three games of the Kollection are less appealing than before. The horrible lag, moreover, prevent players from having fun with the online multiplayer.",
"An evolution of the Tropico 3 engine, Absolute Power takes a good game and makes it better. While situations are often played for laughs there is a serious simulation in here and the new features show more of it. Definitely worth the purchase price for fans of the original.",
"South of Midnight isn't going to impress with constant new mechanical gimmicks, and the gameplay loop quickly becomes predictable, but it is almost hypnotizing in its presentation. Hazel and her supporting cast are delightful, and they're wonderfully brought to life by exceptional animation and voice acting. South of Midnight's twisted take on the American Deep South is bold and captivatingly rendered, but gameplay-forward players are likely to find it lacking.",
"Majora's Mask still feels like the original. The dark style, playing around with time and masks that give the typical Zelda gameplay a twist are things to love about this game. However, we don't feel that 3DS is the ideal platform for this remake.",
Although it's by far the most realistic war game ever created we can't ignore the fact that -as it is at this moment- ARMA III is incomplete. It feels almost like it's in a beta phase.,
"It’s a shame that Riptide couldn’t have been a bit more given how much opportunity there was here for improvement, but as it stands, it’s basically the same flawed game we got nearly two years ago — for better or for worse.",
"If you absolutely must have Shinin' playing on your telly then this could be worth picking up, if not the Xbox Live Arcade edition is a much more solid and prettier looking version of the visceral puzzler.",
"The Sojourn delivers where it counts, offering players a wide variety of puzzles that are as deep as they are engaging. It’s worth your time, even if the game’s graphics aren’t exactly state-of-the-art.",
"I'm not convinced that anyone who hasn't already played the original game -- which is available on Xbox 360 for $20US most places, and just launched on PC with the DLC episodes -- would be able to even marginally follow what the hell is going on in American Nightmare. No doubt it would up the bizarreness of the game for those players but the main draw is more or less for fans only. And, really, this writer is okay with that.",
"There's a very limited selection of game modes. Players can select Single Mission, Multi-Mission, or Multi-Player, however all the game modes feature the same Metroid Pinball tabletop worlds and goals--there's just a lack of variety.",
"Vigil is on to a winner here. By bringing together a host of old-school mechanics, something oddly fresh is created. It would be a crime if this is the last we see of the series, as Death's story indicates the Darksiders universe is only going to get stronger with time.",
"Sorry We're Closed beautifully takes that otherworldly psychological horror of games such as Silent Hill and puts its own colorful spin on things, resulting in a game filled with an eye-popping visual style, a terrific story with a clever look at relationships via angels and demons, and an amazing cast of characters, including one truly memorable and unsettling villain, alongside a lot of other surreal and spooky moments. While the combat may be a tad frustrating later on, it all still makes for a great entry into the genre and definitely one to pick up.",
"For a game that splits between two different dimensions, Crush ends up feeling a little one-dimensional. However, the concept is undeniably ingenious and it is my sincere hope that a sequel will emerge to take it to the next level and produce a true gaming classic.",
"I was attracted to SAC for its style and potential, but with flawed controls and lackluster graphics, I was sorely disappointed. GITS never comes out its shell and remains just another shooter.",
"When everything clicks into place, Alwa’s Legacy soars. The exploration is filled with brain-teasing challenges backed by a great chiptune soundtrack. Hiccups along the way, mostly due to some obtuse item uses, can bring the experience back to Earth, but thankfully, more often than not, this is a super fun game to make your way through.",
"Q Entertainment does it again. They made one of the most distinctive early PSP games, and now they do the same with Vita, managing to create a new and stylish experience that will delight fans of electronic music.",
"You absolutely need more than one (perhaps two) friends to get past the game's flaws: bland menus, a ridiculously annoying announcer, and less than 50 minigames that get old fast. [Mar 2007, p.88]",
"Unfortunately, obtaining that blessing requires a two-mile crawl on your knees through the jagged glass and thorny ivy that is the busted, broken, and simply not fun gameplay of Chamber of Time. Battles are aggravating and exploration is mind-numbing. For as brilliant as the narrative and artistic achievements of Chamber of Time are, it’s weighed down by unpolished game design choices that simply make it no fun to actually play at all.",
"In terms of platforming gameplay, what's on offer here is pretty basic and simple, and certainly not anywhere near as deep or rewarding as ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" or ""Super Mario World.""",
"From its finely honed user interface to its nearly flawless campaign and PvP modes, Homeworld2 is a breath of fresh air when most games of its ilk are bogging themselves down with needless complexity.",
"Elements of Destruction can get a bit repetitive, mostly because you only have 3 elements at your disposal - a tsunami, flood, or avalanche wouldve been cool - but the enjoyment gamers get from laying waste to a wide variety of environments and EoD's oddball humor (Doc Herbert sending cows flying at a farm in Canada while singing the country's national anthem) more than makes up for its shortcomings.",
"Melbits World is a game with great ideas, that can be challenging and complex, but also simple and accessible. It depends on how many people and the type of people you play with, but you’ll definitely have fun with it.",
"In all honesty, the simplification of the controls and hit-miss nature of the superstar mode mean that Sega Superstar Tennis isn’t quite as good as the tennis masterclass that was ""Virtua Tennis 3.""",
"Paleo Pines is overpriced and not worth it, because it doesn't come close to good farming sims or cozy games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley. The graphics and animations are lackluster. In addition, many mechanics are very tedious and annoying. The only unique factor, the cute dinosaurs, is simply not convincing enough to outweigh the flaws.",
"And holy cow, if it's sheer bat-guano crazy you're after, you'll love Versus mode. Pick from 45 (!) unlockable characters and square off against 11 other nutjobs (humans or bots) in completely ridiculous battle royales over Live. We'd happily pay 10 bucks just to listen to the chaos in each wild melee.",
"Lets hope that the next episode has a bit more bulk, because there's heaps of potential. I look forward to meeting up with Fone, Phoney and Smiley again and seeing them safely home.",
"This is an honest entry into football gaming, the kind you can buy this year and enjoy for two, or three seasons, or however long it takes for EA Sports to add new features worth checking out. Career Mode remains a far cry from Football Manager, and the licensing situation might as well have changed the series name to ""European Football 25"". Odds are it will not get better for a while. FC 25 is like watching football: a mix of great moments, frustration, and occasionally asking yourself ""Why did I put two hours into this"". The answer is that FC 25, like football, is just good fun.",
"Dicefolk is an intriguing take on the roguelike that gives you an unprecedented level of control over everything, and still makes you sweat in battle. It's cute, the replayability is very high, and it's got some fun progression unlocks as well. Definitely grab it if you're a turn-based roguelike person.",
"The cliche with EA Sports games is that they’re always an iterative step. But, outside of the mid-console generation graphical similarity, there’s a lot that EA Sports FC 25 does which isn’t iterative. The big changes brought about by FC IQ, Cranium and Rush make for an interesting gameplay refresh which gives new impetus to both competitive online modes and long-underserved offline careers.",
"Hunt the Night is a love letter to 16-bit era action adventure games. There’s something for fans of almost every genre in this gem of a game. I won’t be surprised if it finds a fairly major audience. It’s a concise synthesis of so many great gameplay and visual ideas. All of my complaints are minor nitpicks. And they’re still just based on my personal preferences. If a physical console version becomes available, I’ll be first in line to buy it.",
"Not everything used to be better in the past, but Yar's Revenge sure was. This game should have stayed in the past because the boring storyline and the repetitive gameplay just aren't up to date.",
"Not for everyone, Dancing All Night will suit players who love rhythm action enough to overlook a lack of content, or who love Persona 4 enough to forgive the length and leaden pace of its script. [Jan 2016, p.123]",
"Splatoon 2 is an incredible shooter that improves on the original in almost every single way. But if you still have a Wii U and don't care about taking it on the go, there might not be enough new content to justify the purchase.",
"Much like the titular protagonist having to restore his name and save face, The First Berserker: Khazan overcomes doubt that there is room for new, great big beasts in the Souls-like space. It may not be the most original experience and may be overflowing with too much loot, but despite that, it provides incredible play variety, meaningful character progression, spectacle, and exciting boss encounters to boot. Bathed in blood and dripping in metal-as-hell edge and angst, The First Berserker: Khazan is another unbelievably fun and great action RPG for the books.",
"Although Age of Wonders 4 may seem at first overwhelming, it's actually not. Many automatisms help beginners, and gradually you'll be able to abandon them if you want to. In the end, its great flexibility offers an enormous replay value and encourages you to try out all possible combinations.",
"Neon White is one of those games you wish you knew about when they were red hot. Its a game that puts everything that he has on gameplay, and it works marvelously. If you enjoy fast paced shooting and like a good challenge, you should definitely try this game.",
"With a comprehensive class-based multiplayer rounding off the package, Bound in Blood is an altogether more polished prospect than its predecessor. At the very least it’s a hugely enjoyable parade of satisfying shooting galleries. But when it finds its stride, it’s a thrilling, wild ride down a road that remains surprisingly less traveled.",
"Without a way to fail, the game just soldiers on like its fishing minigame: a thing that’s tedious but not at all difficult, and which simply continues until players either succeed or become bored enough to give up.",
"Darksiders II is a great follow-up aimed mainly at the fans of the first game. Fortunately it can easily appeal to players unfamiliar with War's adventures, players simply looking for a good slasher. The game offers lots of fun, making the player not only show off his/her skills in fighting and jumping, but in logical thinking as well. The game's quality suffers a tiny bit because of its graphics and lack of a really ""big"" ending. But remember - these small flaws are not enough to discourage anyone. Darksiders II is a great investment that will keep you glued to the screen for a long time.",
"Tiberium Wars is Command & Conquer at its best, and an absolute blast for series fans and newcomers alike...It's simply a superb game that's fun and exciting to play both online and off.",
Even when it hits the $20 bargain bins it's still going to be a bad game. I can't stress enough that if you have a PC remotely capable of playing Mafia then please get the PC version.,
"With impressive storytelling, amazing combat and interesting upgrading systems, Throne and Liberty excels where many MMORPGs fail right off the bat. My main concern is that I just don't know if there is something there to keep me coming back and wanting to improve my character. If I don't know how well I'm performing and how much I'm contributing to the group, how will I know I need to improve? Furthermore, if there are further ways to optimize my character, how will I know the changes I make are making a large difference, other than a ""gut feel"" when attacking enemies.",
"While this bunny can be funny, his game is lame, and even its standout segments aren't particularly strong--they just seem that way in comparison to the overall mess. Weak charm and knowing references aside, we can confidently give Hell Yeah a ""hell no.""",
"One-third of a complete game, and it really feels like it. Despite the fairly large variety in things to do, all of it feels like setup for something that is going to happen later on.",
"There's a genuine sense of achievement and enjoyment when a seemingly impossible level suddenly clicks (or crushes) into place, and the confident way the game uses its central conceit as more than just a gimmick is undeniably reassuring and appealing.",
"Concord isn’t the most innovative or content-heavy hero shooter you could play, but with such fantastic competitive gameplay, 16 compelling characters to master, and 12 well-designed maps, it’s got the makings of something that could go the distance in the months and years to come. In fact, it’s a testament to its FPS chops that even while it has a virtually nonexistent story and a serious need for a signature game mode, I still found myself losing dozens of hours to its PvP charms. Hopefully the live-service roadmap will do its thing and show this promising shooter the love it needs to become something truly special, but right now it’s at least good enough for me to recommend trying out.",
"The Metal Gear myth has never before appeared so agile, fresh and youthful, but more than the setting its Platinum's virtuoso coders that shine throughout, the object slicing a marvel of high-speed 3D manipulation. A technical masterpiece, Rising offers a funfair ride approximation of Konami's brooding series, but one with more than enough capacity for the Bayonetta veteran to express their dexterous expertise.",
"The legendary RTS milestone comes back with a new look and an updated gameplay, but with some old mechanics and too much crashes, freezes and unstable frame rate, it can't be still a masterpiece.",
"Ikenfell has a unique battle system and story that can make for some of the best moments in an RPG this year, but unfortunately it doesn’t always use these to its advantage and has multiple boring boss fights with the plot meandering in the first half. Still, its highs are so high that it is well worth seeing through to the end.",
"Biomotor Unitron is a competent dungeon crawler and mech-building RPG. Little about it is bad, but little is interesting, and it’s very much a game of its time. The biggest issue with recommending it today is that the Switch in 2022 is not the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1999. That system desperately needed a competent RPG, and Biomotor Unitron was able to fill that hole. The Switch doesn’t need that, though. Between classic releases and new titles, it has one of the strongest RPG lineups any system has ever seen. In that context, it’s hard to recommend it to many players today.",
"If you're looking for the hottest new RPG with the flashiest graphics and some newfangled game mechanics, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. But if you're into the anime and want something that's guaranteed to have you playing well into the wee hours, this game is going to be smiling and waving at you the next time you're at your favorite game shop.",
"The options for the games, whilst interesting, are not where they should be, especially given some of the more recent classic collections. And finally, there are the games. 150 games listed is technically accurate, but still factually wrong; whilst a lot of the games included are fun to play with still, there are a lot, mostly the sports games, that are not, so the overall collection just feels less. Fans of Atari, or anyone who grew up with those games, will find a lot of enjoyment in the collection though, so it is not all bad.",
"South of Midnight is a masterclass in picking a theme and sticking to it all the way through. The usage of music as a character world/lore enhancement is one of the best examples out there of what TO do. From the character models, to the music, and beyond; South of Midnight shows how to build a game around a style and committing fully.",
"Pikuniku is relentlessly charming throughout its short-but-sweet several hours of play. Many of the more enjoyable moments aren’t even mission-critical, so you’d do well to keep your eyes peeled for bonus nonsensical hijinks rather than just speed your wobbly red appendages towards the conclusion. While not the most sophisticated experience, Pikuniku is a bonkers trip worth leaving your cave for.",
"Darksiders 2 ""the game"" is worth your time. Darksiders 2 the story is a little forgettable - and that's a bit disappointing, considering the first game contains one of my favourite moments in recent video game history.",
"It is the best looking space combat sim we've seen so far... Unfortunately it is let down all too often by poor mission scripting and incompetent wingmen, not to mention the occasional random crash.",
"Age of Wonders 4 brings the franchise back to its fantasy roots, offering a robust system that lets you go all-out with customization. Whether you’re out to role-play based on your selections or min-max to come up with game-breaking setups, you’re bound to spend numerous hours just trying out new strategies.",
"Its most obvious faults, in addition to a limp writing and quests that are not always interesting, are all found in the problems that have also characterized Summerset: that is, a structured ""campaign"" to be enjoyed alone, as well as badly integrated with a game world populated by hundreds of people.",
"Gamers looking for a vast, expansive trick system like the one in the ""Tony Hawk"" games might find their wings clipped in Downhill Domination, but the responsive physics and no-rules mayhem work surprisingly well. It's fast -- perhaps a little too fast.",
"Vermintide is great when it comes to depth and replay value. The classes bring a good mix and a strong combination with the very well developed melee system. There are few small bugs, but this still is a very solid co-op experience.",
"Despite the fact that the plot is less interesting than the one from the first chapter, and that the story lacks momentum in its first half, it's one hell of a ride, and it will make you feel like Batman once again.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition is the best game released for Switch so far in 2020. Its roots might be a decade long, but its excellence in the context of the here and now, in comparison to other role-players on the platform, cannot be undersold.",
"Unfortunately, Exigo comes from the big book of fantasy strategy clichés and does not bring anything new to the genre.Still, it is a well done real-time strategy and definitely worth its price. [Jan. 05]",
"Beneath an amazingly intimidating shell, lies an amazingly complex, deep and satisfying strategy game. Few gamers will pass the first, really hard impact, but those few will be engaged and excited, and, eventually, happy.",
"A Fisherman's Tale is still great four years later, but if you've played it before there's not much reason to pick up this barebones port to the PS VR2. It would've been cool to see InnerspaceVR take the opportunity to flesh out its recursive puzzle concept even more, but hopefully there's more still to come from this franchise.",
"While it is one of the better looking first-person games to come out this year, it isn’t the most technically savvy. The gameplay isn’t perfectly honed, but an ever-changing mix of clever ideas, evocative locations, and engaging characters tap the best traditions of the Western genre.",
"Iron Man only just scrapes itself above being a typical movie tie-in title by virtue of some nifty flight controls and the excellent suit. The missions are fun but repetitive and with a lack of a proper checkpoint system and muddy backgrounds, this fails to take off into the stratosphere of a top-quality 360 experience.",
"While it’s not my favorite bundle they have released, it most certainly has some fun times in it. RPG and Kingdom Hearts fans should not shy away from this one. Still, seeing as how 2.5 HD had both Kingdom Hearts 2 and Birth by Sleep in it and this package only has a full game and a 2 hour episode, I would say at least wait for a slight price drop.",
Dead Cells takes some of the very best ideas from Rouge-lite and Metroidvania titles to make an action packed platformer that smartly allows the player to unravel the game's secrets.,
"While my review may seem overly positive, the game's small number of flaws are incredibly frustrating at times. That said, if you feel you can look past a few missed opportunities and a flawed but fun combat system, I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy The Last Story. Just don't expect it to be as genre defining as previous Sakaguchi titles.",
"Endless Space 2 is the game that the fans of the 4X genre wanted and expected. Not only it is great for the most experienced players, but also has a style that is perfect for newcomers.",
"If you're a fan of the Astro Boy character, buying Astro Boy: Omega Factor is a no-brainer. But even if you're not, the game is produced so well in every regard that it's well worth playing through.",
"If you've never played Heroes though, the current installment isn't that bad: 50 campaign hours, Hot Seat to keep my friends close, online multiplayer and many customization options. If the bugs are solved and the designers actually listen to the criticism, the next game will gain more favor.",
"A Space for the Unbound tells a beautiful story with a lot of humanity and fantastic elements. Although its gameplay can get a bit tedious, it is an experience that we recommend to indie game lovers.",
"Mystery Mayhem offers ex-stoners and kids of all ages a multi-episode mystery for the ages by pretty much reinventing the old Genesis ""Ghosbusters"" in 3D, only with all the extra refinements 3D affords. [Mar 2004, p.59]",
"With After Us, Piccolo Studio presents platform gameplay with many alternatives, set in a unique version of a desolate world. That's enough for After Us to be considered a good game. But in reality it is more than that. After Us is also a life lesson.",
"Crimsonland is a fun game to sit down with two or more players while trying to compete for a spot on the leaderboards, but it ultimately feels more like a distraction itself, than a twin-stick murderfest without distractions.",
"This game is a challenging metroidvania. You play in a gorgeous surrounding with an intriguing backstory, which is divided by challenging boss fights. However, the more time you spend, the more boring this game becomes. It is predictable and it lacks having real interesting developments throughout.",
Follows every role-playing clich&#233; and rule but does so with style. Sadly however the flaws within the game remain too obvious and Sword of Mana is merely a slightly above average game that deserves a slightly above average score.,
"The biggest enhancements come in the single-player experience - always the worst part of the previous games. This time, Nintendo has clearly put some thought into it and come up with a story mode that actiually has a point, rather than being a player-vs-computer rehash of Party mode. [Jan 2004, p.113]",
"Gremlins, Inc. is virtual board game set in a original steampunk world populated by corrupt gremlins. The digital nature of the game doesn’t add anything compared to a classic board game. Unfortunately, the complexity of mechanisms is overbalanced by a widespread use of randomness.",
"These new free-roaming, carjacking Haven City segments are both Jak II's triumph and biggest failing. They're a triumph because they add variety and give you some control over what you tackle next, yet they fail because they're punch-you-in-the-gut difficult. [Nov 2003, p.182]",
"Wattam is a game that simply wants to put a smile on your face. It doesn't last very long, it doesn't require much skill from the player, and it doesn't have a complex story to tell. That also means it doesn't overstay its welcome, and that almost anybody can pick it up and enjoy it.",
The real problem with Sega Superstars Tennis is really that it is aimed at kids who are too young to remember most of these characters and casual gamers who could care less. Gamers who fondly remember these classic characters are not likely to sit around and play minigames and mediocre arcade tennis for hours on end.,
"I wouldn't recommend that version of Sega Superstars Tennis to anyone who isn't a massive fan of the company. I had high hopes, but with so many simple yet crucial issues here, it looks like we're going to have to wait for the inevitable sequel before truly enjoying our trip down memory lane.",
"Outrun Online Arcade is, essentially, the same game that arrived on PS2, Xbox and PSP three years ago, but it's still a great offering for arcade lovers. Several game modes, great visuals and a lot of fun in a game that it's worth it, if you don't own last-gen entries.",
"An excellent port of console fighting game hiding behind its jaunty good-looking graphics an entertaining fighting-system, a great number of playable characters and mainly its fine worked-out online/local multiplayer.",
"Those Who Remain is a good horror experience in a genre filled by many similar games. It offers good story and interesting puzzles, and throws some decision making your way, but also suffers from many technical and design issues that prevent it from being good enough for all tastes.",
"Those who remain to the end of this game might find some tidbits of enjoyment in the puzzles, or weighing up some pretty heavy narrative decisions. But Those Who Remain too often forgoes its better ideas, for ones derived from better, more well-executed horror games and doesn't execute those very well.",
"This is aimed at new players, but the new additions make it interesting for those who already played it as well. Sine Mora EX still is a great game, so any new features are always welcomed.",
"Fun for belting out a few tunes at a party, Singstar Ultimate Party simply doesn't offer the variety to give it any form of longevity. Add to that some serious mic pickup issues, and the game quickly loses any party charm.",
"Legions of Steel does something wrong. I love turn-based tactical games, but this did not connect at any level. Bland graphics, too big levels causing a lot of empty turns, on which move too many units. [Oct 2015]",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is the best way to discover Dream Drop Distance (if you didn't play the original) and a wonderful teaser for Kingdom Hearts 3. But the wait, supposed to be easier, is now worse. ¡Come on, Nomura! ¡Bring it on!",
"Oil Rush is simple, intuitive and technically sound. However, there is only one way to really appreciate its qualities: the multiplayer. Unfortunately at this time the online fan base is still very small.",
"A realistic take on the Nidhogg formula does sound intriguing. However, after spending some time with Griefhelm, I would much rather go back to the outlandishly gross-out world of Nidhogg 2 than hang around this bland, grim-dark setting.",
"While its sad to say that the two character carts in Double Dash is more of a gimmick than a significant gameplay enhancement to the Mario Kart franchise, the game is certainly entertaining in its own right, though a little more polish and refinement could have lead to a spectacular game, instead of a pretty good one.",
"Taken individually, each section of Hell Yeah! could be called derivative. Put them all together, and the game as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It may lean toward the easy side, but for anyone who grew up during the 16-bit era, Hell Yeah! hits all of the right notes.",
"But with Tetsuya Mizuguchi's often bland musical experimentation replaced with some of electronica's finest moments, Electronic Symphony breathes new life into a series that had previously appeared stagnant.",
"Freedom's slower pace, lack of story, and frustrating camera do little to warm the cockles of an action fan's heart, but those brave enough to slog through its rough spots will find the game improves with time.",
"Redefines what ""over-the-top"" means with its outrageous campaign, and is able to do so without changing the formula that makes a Japanese action hack n' slash game compelling for every type of player. The gameplay though, while certainly more complex than it looks, has some weaknesses, which are more than enough to keep Rising from... ahem, rising to the top of the genre.",
"Dark Vale Games created an enjoyable mix between massive role-playing and action games, focused on the PvP. Forge is then a good game, with great potential, but at the moment it just lacks some key elements. We really hope that the development team will go ahead with the support, keeping its promises to expand the game.",
"Why are so many missions so dull? Why is the combat-radio voice work so insipid? And which unemployed sports commentator and soccer mom did the tutorial and combat voices, respectively?",
"It provides a truly electric action experience, building on the original with intense, astonishingly epic set-pieces. What's more, the presentation is the closest we’ve got to starring in a full-blown action flick. However, the game is also bereft of any genuine surprises and for all of its stunning visuals and masterful firefights, it’s all a little too predictable.",
"The unavoidable reality is that, for all Rock Band 3's considerable refinements and intuitive advancements, your current games and equipment will probably suffice if you're just after banging a few plastic keys to the odd tune every now and then.",
"The game's still challenging and addictive, and we're not surprised at how engrossing it is this time around because we've already learned that fact twice before. But Konami still hasn't addressed the issues from past games, most notably adding some sort of tutorial to bring in a new audience.",
"But if you don&#146;t mind your BMX mixed with a whole heap of fun (why wouldn&#146;t you?) then you&#146;ll love the game&#146;s unique concept, giant courses and impressive graphics.",
"If you have any hopes for this story building on Metal Gear lore or giving you a chance to reconnect with characters you care about, you will be disappointed. The new characters are uninteresting and poorly developed, and the old characters are practically non-existent.",
"Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway is the ideal game to break out for a night of family fun, especially if you have kids in need of entertainment. The colorful cast of familiar faces, as well as a host of stunning tracks, makes for a perfect party game if you can get enough people into the same room...However, its surprising amount of depth is wasted by an unchallenging AI and lack of real opponents to face online, meaning that solo racers without any love for Nickelodeon’s shows will find little incentive to carry on once the novelty has worn off.",
"The differences make for a fun single-player experience that fits into the lore of the Witcher world. However, this isn’t the kind of game to play if you are after a fully immersive story. On the contrary, Gwent: Rogue Mage’s story mostly ends with the intro video and flavor voice lines from the two main characters. Now, if you want a game to kill some hours with some fun mechanics and a lot to unlock and learn, then Rogue Mage may be what you’re after.",
"Batman: Arkham Knight is not just the best Batman-game and the best comic book game ever, the game also has one of the most fun open worlds we've ever seen in videogame history. Rocksteady perfected its formula, but did take it a bit too far with the Batmobile.",
"Pikuniku is a fun title with an interesting story. Despite its short duration and low difficulty, it is a great experience that deserves to be tried by every player looking to have a fun time.",
"Four great games, probably some of the best entries on MegaMan's series. Unfortunately, it lacks some kind of extras and it's just an emulation that doesn't even expand to the whole size of the DS screen. It's a shame, but the games are so good nonetheless, that this Collection is worth it even so.",
"Though plagued by a number of problems, not least the average nature of the gameplay, Fur Fighters on PS2 does attempt to invest some new life into the game and does better last year''s Dreamcast original. If you want to play last year&#146;s games today, then you can do no better than Fur Fighters.",
"Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is a step backward in this new spin-off series. It has a lot of content, but the episodic nature of the game has contributed some problems to the story and the gameplay, both of which are full of fillers.",
"By and large, GotL just doesn&#146;t bring enough to the table. The new missions are fun, but the fact that this expansion has been divided from it&#146;s evil counterpart and the overall sense of the game actually being Disciples II Gold Edition 0.5 makes the game feel like a jip when you can get so much more out of the original Disciples II for a fraction of the cost.",
"If not for some annoying technical issues and the generic plot, Shadows: Awakening would have probably been one of the best aRPGs launched this year. Still, there are a lot of good things that I've experienced during my playthrough, such as the innovative combat system that offers lots of tactical options, the smooth switching between characters, as well as the eye candy landscapes. Heretic Kingdoms remains a franchise with great potential, so I'm very curious to see where developers are going to go from here. Obviously, there's room to improve the formula, but I'd like to see something new as well.",
"Everything about it is done right. Control is easy to grasp, the audio, graphic, and level designs are top shelf, the storytelling is head and shoulders above most other games, and the Insanity Meter ads a sick twist – it gets the adrenaline pumping.",
"Its inventive and addicting gameplay was clearly built in such a way as to place maximum value on the DS touch screen. A compelling and engrossing story was constructed around these gameplay mechanics, and an attractive and unique visual style was created to display such a game.",
"Colorful vistas and ear-pleasing music are the few things that bring Drakensang closer to its eminent North American brethren. Alas, it is not enough for a good game, especially the one that wants to become the RPG of the year and gain a cult following. One would need talented writers and interesting game design for that.",
"Some ideas here might have worked well if the developers had honed in on a few systems to perfect. Instead, the game throws so many overwhelming systems at you that many get lost in the shuffle. As much as I like to root for the underdog and want to see niche games catapult to new heights, Mugen Souls needs so much refining that I can't cheer it on.",
"Overall Bellator MMA Onslaught has the base to be a good game, however there are just far too many niggles at the moment. It is a game that feels like another year of development would have worked wonders. Working on the animations so that everything linked together in a more natural way and fleshing out the modes on offer would have made this a worthy purchase. As it is though, it is one to pick up only if you are desperately after a fighting game.",
"The game’s pinball mechanics, save for the somewhat inept table-tilting feature, are expertly implemented, and the numerous flavors of Metroid have been liberally sprinkled throughout the experience the ensure fans of the franchise will come away both smiling and humming a familiar tune.",
"Explore the titular island in Paleo Pines as you embark on a quest to collect all of the numerous dinos and variants in a fun exploration-focused title that leaves its life simulator aspects behind — oftentimes, for the better.",
"Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition offers a huge wealth of content, and all of the dinosaur park building you could ever want, but the drop in visual quality to squeeze it onto the Switch will prove too much for some people.",
"Final Fantasy 7 is an excellent RPG with some of the best characters in the gaming canon. While some open-world content skirts the edges, and the game's main narrative is left somewhat deflated, the time spent with Aerith, Tifa, and the gang makes this a hugely enjoyable road trip you'll be playing for hundreds of hours.",
"With its modern setting and effective scares, Calling is not a boring way to whimper away a few evenings. Just a shame silly artistic choices severely dampen the effect. [Mar 2010, p.50]",
"Unfortunately, what was promised with After Us did not come to fruition due to lackluster design and aspects that worked in contrast to each other rather than cohesively. Instead, we are left with a nice looking world yet below average platformer and hope for what may have been with a worn out “humans killed the planet” trope and poor execution.",
"It’s a simple well-presented trivia game’s perfect for quick, bite-sized casual gaming for the whole family. Its questions aren’t nearly as varied or interesting as the ones you’d find in You don’t Know Jack, but they definitely have broader appeal. If trivia’s something you enjoy, and you miss games like Buzz, Knowledge is Power is lot of fun.",
"This is easily the best game in the series and one of the most recommended buys of the launch portfolio of the PSVITA. It doesn't make the most of the console technical prowess nor uses imaginatively any of its touch control possibilities, but it is a puzzle game that fans of the genre will love for months.",
"I have to say that overall I was pleasantly surprised with Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team. From the great visuals and sound, to the addictive gameplay, this is a pretty good XBLA title. The only thing that hurts this game somewhat is the short gameplay length and lack of online cooperative play. That being said, fans of twin-stick shooters, and fans of the Warhammer universe alike, will enjoy this title.",
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a simple, short and easy platform game. Despite the new coat of paint on the graphics and animations, it's still the same PS1 game underneath. If your nostalgia for the title is high, it might be worth checking out. Otherwise, because of its low difficulty, it's a game recommended for children. The duration, however, will be short in any case.",
"The difficulty curve is spot-on but storytelling pacing could be better and more emotional. With core game play that becomes as monotonous as you'd expect, the side-stories needed higher stakes for more emotional investment.",
"Newcomers to the franchise will likely be more forgiving of many flaws, much like many of us were with the first Dead Island, considering the fun zombie-bashing core and unique dichotomy of an apocalypse in paradise has remained intact. Veterans of the first Dead Island, on the other hand, will feel cheated, as they’ll recognize the cheap carbon copy that Riptide actually is. Combine this with glitches galore and a plot with more holes in it than the sinking ship the game starts off on, and it’s hard to recommend Riptide to all but the most naïve of zombie enthusiasts.",
"The game has some interface issues, unsatisfying military options, and an overall lack of variety in the cities you build. As impressive as the cities look, they all start to feel the same after a while.",
"While I can’t say I’ll reach for this over its predecessors, Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! Is a good (replayable) entry more often than not, and recommended. Younger players and families who can enjoy local co-op should have this higher on their wishlist than solo players who might wait for a sale (or update with more online options). The new Puzzle Bobble vs. Space Invaders is a sizable draw!",
"From bedrooms containing clever and mysterious moving panels to a 'Land of the Giants'-style pool challenge, each section delivers something new and exciting to motivate deeper exploration. [Apr 2004, p.110]",
"It’s more style than substance, but that isn’t a bad thing. However, Platinum Games hasn’t fully embraced this fact and tried to bring a serious story with depth to the table. In which it failed miserably. The game is pure action: a hack and slash game you’ll have to memorize to master. The Blade Mode is a great addition to the series, but the parry system isn’t quite as memorable. The total package, however, is a game that belongs to the top of its class, mainly thanks to the great art style and the brutal, yet amazing music.",
"Sadly, Trek to Yomi looks and feels noticeably outdated for such an aesthetically pleasing game. And its archaic gameplay can’t be completely covered up by its artistic black-and-white filter. Trek to Yomi tried to reach the heights of lauded Japanese filmmaking, but unfortunately, it falls almost as flat as its 2D combat plane.",
Quarrel is a charming and challenging little wordgame for a very resonable price. It's cleverly designed and is a delight to play against friends over Xbox Live or in your living room.,
"Ultimately, there may not be all that much that's genuinely new about Rock of Ages 2, but the sheer solidity of what's on offer here affirms that ACE Team have hewn themselves a sequel that nobody asked for, yet will find handily enjoyable anyway.",
"Although Rogues Heroes is another Zelda-esque dungeon crawler, it sets itself apart with its numerous class options, captivating environments, and addictive gameplay! The game has bugs and glitches, which can be annoying, especially in co-op mode. Nonetheless, it offers an entertaining adventure you won’t want to miss!",
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms leads with an incredible premise and promising gameplay tools, only to become encumbered by those very same elements. Your dreams of hot-blooded conquest in imperial China can be realized eventually, though you'll wish that experience had been available right from the beginning! [Issue #61 – September/October 2022, p. 27]",
"The Metronomicon is a rhythm game like few others. Any good programmer can put together a soundtrack and slap arrows on the songs, but The Metronomicon sets itself apart by way of numerous RPG mechanics that actually make you strategize a bit while you’re trying to keep the rhythm of the song going. Building note sets, queuing up the attacks, switching party members, defeating enemies, and surviving battles put The Metronomicon quite a step above most other rhythm games we’ve played. Moreover, it has just enough context in its story to keep things amusing in between and the soundtrack is a pretty fantastic mix of contemporary styles across the music industry. We just wish we had a dance pad to go with it when our hands start cramping.",
"Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a pretty fun arcade shooter when someone is sitting beside you. Co-op is the only good part of this game because the singleplayer is seriously lacking and online support is nowhere to be found.",
"Root Double lets itself down in the way it indulges nonsense like scientific explanations and science fiction when really it wants to be a taut psychological thriller about a group of people caught in a truly desperate situation. Thankfully, when it focuses on what it's best at it's a near-on perfect example of the genre. It can be both bewildering and exhausting, but one thing Root Double will never let you forget is that it is also compelling.",
"South of Midnight is an impressive narrative feat from Compulsion Games. It’s a well-paced adventure that goes big on characters and story, though combat and platforming feel a bit uniform. I hope it’s not the last we’ve seen of this world and these characters.",
"An average tie-in that's not without its merits, and one that will appeal to fans of the film and a younger audience. Jaded older gamers however will find very little to sustain your interest.",
"Overclocked’s complex and rich setting is ultimately just that – a setting. Too many things let the game down for it to be truly recommendable, like stiff animation, poor audio editing and a lack of insight into your own character’s agenda.",
"One of those rare games that can be appreciated by both hardcore and casual fans alike, Final Fantasy XII may very well be Square's last great adventure, and a fitting sendoff, for the PlayStation 2.",
"Overall, Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a fun title. If you are a fan of the Warhammer universe you should have fun controlling the Space Marines and if you aren't familiar with the franchise you should still have fun killing a lot of enemies and blowing stuff up.",
"For maximum enjoyment, Wattam expects you to meander, to mosey, to stride. A frantic pace will only lay bare the shaky controls and the counter-intuitive camera setup. Take your time, the game insists. Speak to every new citizen, wear all of their hats, propel them skyward with your hat bombs. This way, the good times can dwell while the pockets of misery remain distant and hazy. For me, the off-putting voices and the clumsy controls work with the sparse conceit to create a world that’s oddly ill-fitting. The idyllic madness and the slow, sparse mechanics butt heads to make a game best approached with caution and care. Choose the world of Wattam at your most studious discretion, my friends.",
"Online racing thrills like you&#146;ve never seen before. Combine this with a race editor that allows you to reconfigure checkpoints for your own customized races, and what we have here is a game with replay value that flies over a ramp and off the charts.",
"An outstanding game - the best the series has ever seen. A great technical foundation has been laid with this year's outing, and true Madden fans will appreciate the package EA has put together.",
"It’s no must buy, but in the grand scheme of things, this isn’t a half bad slash ‘em up. People uninterested in the story should enjoy the maniacal combat, fans of Wolverine may find that they really enjoy it.",
"Yes, I have had some issues with Ronin, but I’ve still had fun. Enjoyable and frustrating this game may be, when all is said and done, there isn’t anything quite as satisfying as surprise tossing a thug out of a tenth story window and watching him sail into the darkness.",
"In the end, Samurai Warriors 4 Empires is basically the same as Samurai Warriors 4-II, but with a heavy emphasis on pre-combat strategy and no interesting storylines for the characters. Fans of the series will appreciate the variation on gameplay, but there's nothing to draw new players to the franchise.",
"Like Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, this is a game that is simplistic in concept but catered heavily toward fans of the series. Yet unlike Theatrhythm’s serviceable-yet-sterile insert of characters and compositions, Dancing All Night goes the extra mile to ensure that Persona 4’s beloved cast bring their A-game to this endearing love letter in addition to its plethora of toe-tapping remixes.",
"It's so much easier to forgive glitches, outdated visuals and flick-book framerate when you've got a friend laughing at them too, but this doesn't mean we should forgive them. Should Riptide wash up on your shore, you'd best throw in back in.",
"At the end of the day, Diablo 2: Resurrected certainly feels like a game that is designed with veteran and nostalgic players in mind and it truly nails the experience in that sense. Whether it’s going to be able to build a new audience with first-time players is a much tougher question, but the old school experience may have more to offer modern gamers than it appears at first glance. Diablo 2: Resurrected fills a very unique spot in the franchise’s offerings by allowing players to continue returning to D3 (and someday Diablo 4 for a modern experience), but also now having a visually modern option when they want a bit more baseline difficulty and a classic experience.",
"Those Who Remain looks and plays like it come through a time portal from the mid-90s. The graphics are washed-out, plain, and badly angular. The frame rate is choppy despite the simplicity of visuals and jerks horribly when turning the viewpoint. There is no cohesion to the production design; nonspecific props are just scattered all over the place and random images from the web are plastered into frames that decorate walls. The main character’s sedated delivery kills off the rest of the atmosphere. And no, being indie isn’t a plausible excuse because there are plenty of similar but better-done indie horror games out there. All in all, Those Who Remain is an unfortunate attempt at psychological horror that goes on to show it’s a hard genre to get it right.",
"Despite a solid and fun gameplay, Concord falls short in several other aspects, including its competitive modes and the lack of charisma of its characters. It's an average experience that can be fun in short doses and rewarding to the player who invests time on it, but it doesn't do enough to keep you hooked.",
"Rollerdrome has one of the most intoxicating and satisfying gameplay loops in recent memory, and while the game suffers from some janky moments and underwhelming bosses, there’s no ignoring how good it feels to shoot, flip, and grind through each level. We just wish there was more.",
"The Sniper Challenge isn't part of Hitman: Absolution so it's definitely worth pre-ordering if you're a fan of the series. Asides from the fact there's only one level, the game is fun and addictive and it's not a bad incentive to pre-order Hitman: Absolution. Better than some extra guns anyway, that's for sure.",
"Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is mostly fun when playing with a well put together team of criminals. It's weaker when playing with unknown accomplices or when stealing alone. The game is just a little bit too unclear and chaotic to be a great stealth game, but as a party game Monaco is an excellent choice. It's mostly the charming style that'll steal your heart, not the chaotic action.",
The gameplay is very much like that of the earliest real-time strategy games. This is a traditional RTS that seemingly ignores all the advances that the genre has experienced over the past several years.,
"Instead of focusing on one major aspect of the game, the developers seemed to try and cram too much into this DS title, causing each style element to become watered down in the gameplay department.",
"If you're looking for a game that's going to keep you on the edge of your seat, keep looking. This one is definitely not for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy a game that will severely challenge your intellect (or you happen to hold a doctorate in economics or politics), then I heartily recommend this one.",
"Cities XL 2012 is just adding a year to Cities XL 2011 with a few new maps and buildings, and providing access to user modifications for first time in the series. If you purchased the previous edition it might be of interest thanks to its discount for previous buyers. If you didn't but wanted to, do not hesitate to buy it now. It's almost the same fun as Cities XL 2011.",
"Nothing in Knowledge is Power really hooked me, but it’s certainly serviceable as a fun distraction. The power plays and bonus rounds mean you and your friends will probably get a good couple of hours of fun out of this, though it likely won’t replace your usual favorite trivia board game.",
"SiN Episodes: Emergence starts out great, with intense action and awesome physics. Unfortunately, the game grows very repetitive before too long, and will leave many players bored and wanting more diversity.",
"Visually the game is absolutely stunning, with in-game character models that are at least three times as detailed as those seen in the first game. Level design is artistic as it is functional. [Nov 2003, p.32]",
"The game&#146;s soundtrack is good, fitting the happy nature of the game. The sound effects are plentiful, especially the ambient effects like birds chipping in the background and Harry weeping when he enters dark places.",
"While it's great to build your own hunter and create weapons and armor with creative aspects, and some of the monster hunting is thoroughly enjoyable, the game runs into some slight problems with gameplay and camera control that keep it from being in ""freedom"" of flaws.",
"When I was done, I was disappointed that I couldn't start it up all over again as like any adventure game, there's no real replayability here, but ultimately I was glad that I got to spend time with these characters and set up endings for them that allowed them to be as happy as they had made me.",
"Calling a revised version of a five-year-old game Ultimate is a stretch, even if you do add a flawless multiplayer mode and propably the most beautiful graphics seen on Xbox. [Mar. 05]",
"A veritable Matryoshka doll of dark delights, executed to perfection. The turn based combat completely engrosses and could have been a game on its own, but Weappy went the extra mile: they delivered one of the darkest, truest video game narratives of the year.",
"A fully fleshed out multiplayer, realistic and fun driving, tons of variety, and an interesting drivatar feature Forza has everything you could have asked for in a racing game and is bound to please anyone who was looking forward to it, or anyone who likes driving games at all.",
"Oil Rush is an interesting hybrid that combines RTS and Tower Defense mechanics with a great success. Visually remarkable, and with fresh and addictive gameplay, we miss more deep strategy elements.",
"Video games -- not just rhythm games, but all video games -- rarely show this much ambition. Even more rare are occasions where developers manage to fulfill the impossibly lofty goals they set before themselves. Rock Band 3 manages both with ease, backing up brilliant ideas with flawless execution.",
"It is practically an exact a port of the original with a few notable exceptions: There are a few Lumines II skins thrown in, the graphics are far less vibrant, and now there is at least five seconds of total silence between skins as the sounds load. Of all of four Lumines games on the market, this one is the least impressive.",
"A good attempt at approaching the augmented reality for hardcore gamers. It is a nice and fun fighting game, although some combat might become a little repetitive and the game has that much content. However, the use of the cameras to catch the player appareance is very interesting and promises a lot of multiplayer fun.",
"It has all the drama you’d want, all the corruption you’d ask for, and the same gameplay as the first, but expanded upon to make it much more enjoyable. The new squad strategy mode is a huge surprise that was neither asked for nor expected, but it gives the game so much more.",
"Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition is a long name for a long game, a visual novel built around a captivating plot that's anchored on mystery and whose endings make the experience worthwhile. It might feel redundant at certain moments, when the same information is repeated way too many times, but what is on offer in this experience is nothing short of enveloping in its disturbing implications.",
"If you're the biggest Hellboy fan in the world, do not spend $60 on this game; if you're Ron Perlman, do not play the free copy I hope they sent you; and if you're Hellboy, seek vengeance on the people who did this to you.",
"I can only recommend this game to hardcore fans of the genre. Others would find it hard to get much enjoyment from it, especially when there are a lot of great RTS classics out there. This game is six years old and looks it m’lord.",
"Successfully brings an icon into the modern era, and the underlying gameplay still shines. But while Resurrected does a better job than Warcraft III: Reforged, it leaves similar questions unanswered over its feature set and long-term community support.",
"If you are in the need to go into a game and slaughter creatures in a mindless fashion, then Doom II is definitely for you. Do not expect top of the line graphics or high quality music, but you can expect a lot of killing and being killed as you play your way through the slaughterhouse called Doom II again.",
"If you dig deep, you can find charming parts of Valkyria Revolution – the thrill of taking down a group of foes with a well-placed grenade, or the rousing music and majestic scenery combining for a memorable moment. But these bright spots are far too rare in an experience that deals primarily in drudgery, from repetitive missions to overlong expository scenes. Even if you find and appreciate the good parts, the prize is too small for the price you pay on the battlefield.",
"Commandos: Origins is a great game in a genre that sorely needs one. With a difficulty that'll challenge even the most tactical minds, combined with refreshing visuals and characters that are fun to play, what you get is a satisfying,, rewarding experience that has you reloading save after save, believing the next strategy you try will be the winning one. The difficulty may cause the odd frustration here and there, and you may wish for a bit more besides a satisfying gameplay loop, but overall this is a win for the fans of RTS games out there.",
"I honestly had this title under my radar but by the end of it all, I did quite enjoy its entertainment value; and finding a decent Western game is no real easy task with so few being released these days.",
"Forced Showdown is a game that left very little impact on me. I played it, it was a game, and I understood every part of it. The parts come together nicely, but aren't mechanically deep at all. Combat is simple, even with the card system at play, the structure is extremely repetitive, and everything else just falls in line around that.",
"AC4 feels like a house that's been added onto so often that it's a maze of twisting passages, oddly shaped rooms, and doors that go nowhere. There may be something worthwhile hidden within, but it's not worth the effort to find it. Time to tear it all down and start over.",
"The Thaumaturge is a thought-provoking and haunting RPG that expertly combines gameplay and narrative, leading to one of the most unique RPG experiences you’re likely to play this year. Its stunning setting and choice-driven narrative will undoubtedly stick with me for a long time as I reflect on the tough decisions I made with Wiktor as he comes to terms with this dark, fantasy-filled version of Warsaw. The combat arguably takes too long to reveal its riches, but once that initial barrier is overcome, it offers the same level of depth and choice present in other aspects of The Thaumaturge.",
"Thankfully, Death himself is an infinitely more interesting protagonist than War, which makes the story a bit more tolerable. Death is a bit of a wise ass, yet he will stop at nothing to protect those that he cares about. He isn't going to be winning any depth awards anytime soon, but for an action game, he's easily one of the more interesting, and cooler heroes to hit the action scene in the last ten years.",
"The game employs what is known as ""rag-doll physics."" It's meant to replicate the way in which a human being's body reacts to an outside force such as car crash, explosion or bullet. The results are great. Bodies flail and fly with such accuracy that it's sure to put a smile on the lips of you sadistic little bastards out there.",
"Ikenfell is an enjoyable RPG with an interesting story, fleshed-out characters, and a dense turn-based battle system, with a superb soundtrack and some gorgeous environments to boot.",
"Since innovations in this series seem to come in microscopic increments, it's safe to assume each subsequent game will not only feature the elements that made the main game fun, but also the flaws that marred the experience as well.",
"A surprise hit indie for me. It fails to score some high marks in particular areas, but overall is an exceptional endeavor and will offer hours of entertainment if you take the time to know it better. [March 2012]",
"On it's own Fallout 76: Wastelanders is an excellent expansion, but it doesn't completely amend the problems that plague Fallout 76, or subvert the controversy that surrounds it. What it does do is provide a path forward that may eventually lead to Fallout 76 becoming a genuinely good game.",
"Batman: Arkham Knight is a great final chapter for the Rocksteady trilogy, and by far the best title in the series. Amazing storytelling, a solid, well-known yet still engaging gameplay, and a convincing open world are the highlights of a top-notch production. The monumental graphics are just the icing on the cake. Fans of the Caped Crusader, thou shall not miss this game.",
"Whether this release is testing the water for a return to the series, or it's just a dip into the library to throw out a release in January, Onimusha is one of Capcom's finest and least appreciated. Hopefully with this new version, creaky as it can be at times, the game (and franchise) finds some new fans. It would be great to have Onimusha and Nioh competing side by side to have the premier Japanese dark fantasy crown.",
"In some ways the game feels pigeonholed by its genre and its aesthetic qualities don't do it any favors, but Fight'N Rage elevates the hot-blooded action of old-school beat em' ups to new heights.",
"More robust, more extensive, Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate is the most complete version of DOA5 and proves to be an excellent 3D fighting game for those who do not know DOA5 yet. However, it is difficult to recommend it to those who have purchased DOA5, unless they are incorrigible fans who feels like they have to own every episode.",
"For fans of classic stealth games, Evotinction is definitely worth a try. Its various systems, including hacking, tasers, and environmental interaction, greatly expand your stealth options, providing plenty of room for creative gameplay. However, in the later stages, freedom is somewhat restricted due to resource limitations and enemy design. While the story and narrative aren't particularly outstanding, they do offer some unique touches.",
"The most incomprehensible issue is the lack of multiplayer support. It is interesting that Hasbro found the resources to include multiplayer support in the computer version of Battleship while omitting it in a game that literally begs for a human, network-connected crew.",
"Ends up being more inviting than ever to new players, with a clearer plot and goals. The game knows what it does well and highlights it instead of trying too many hit or miss concepts. Despite the sometimes limited scope of its world and objectives, it's a great downloadable that hopefully will introduce a whole new audience to one writer's unique world.",
"The bar for music games has been irrefutably raised. Like magic, gamers can now be transformed into musicians... provided they don't run screaming for the hills at the first sight of a barre chord.",
"Gamers looking for a fun Western-themed shooter should look no further than Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood. There’s nothing incredible about it, but it’s a strong title with a solid enough story to keep most people interested.",
"Sunlight will certainly be beneficial to players who enjoy games like Flower and are looking for a meditation-like place where they can get away from it all for a while. This game would also be a great place for players to return to as a quick-fix to relax. That said, I think to keep Sunlight impactful and interesting over a longer haul, updating the stories would be needed. Overall, Sunlight is worth the short time it takes to complete and makes for the ultimate respite if you need somewhere to restore your thoughts. Even without the visuals, the music and story combined are enough to create a perfect nest that embodies calm, meditation, and awareness of your body. Given the world we live in right now, Sunlight couldn’t have come at a better time.",
"Soldier of Fortune doesn't cross the line of being a bad game, but it hardly ever breaks the surface of mediocrity either. The visuals and sound show lots of polish, but the generic story, horrible voice acting, and cut-scenes, along with the kamikaze A.I. and boring level design, simply don't.",
"There's some joy to be had here, especially when you consider the interesting design of the fighters, who are all in some way based on characters from gothic literature. However, when push comes to shove, there's just not enough here - in terms of depth or contents - to keep you playing for long.",
"I played on the PS4, which most definitely added to my frustration. The beginning is especially overwhelming as the menu options are so dull and dense. There's just too much text to read on my HDTV. (On a PC, I assume with the screen up close, it's not a big deal.) RTSs are often not suited for consoles, and this is sadly one such example.",
"Where it separates itself from the real game is that it allows you to duel the characters from the show with surprising accuracy, you don&#146;t have the problems of picking up or keeping track of your cards and it allows players to play with cards they either can&#146;t afford or haven&#146;t come across yet. A huge bonus.",
"It&#146;s managed to make ostensibly the same game as it always has, but with just a little bit of lateral thinking has revolutionised its own formula. Bring on Age of Bomber Jackets, already.",
"As a game, Wattam is a scatterbrained assembly of goofball logic and cumbersome mechanics. As an experience, it's an earnest expression of love, affinity, and forgiveness shared by all of its moving pieces. The product is a game that elicits joy without the videogame-y demand for precooked gratification. Wattam feels like a birthday party where all of your friends actually show up.",
"Except for a few missing background animations, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the Vita is an exact copy of its bigger brother on the PS3. A technical marvel if you ask us, since Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 isn't known for its static gameplay. [March 2012, p.59]",
"It would be nice to see a season mode as robust as the most recent PS2 version of MotoGP, but as portable games go, what's offered here is sufficient for decent racing action on the go.",
"Guardian Heroes for the Xbox Live Arcade is a great addition to anyone's game library. The game still plays as well as I remember it 15 years ago and the improved visuals really bring it into the modern world. The revamped controls help to alleviate some of the aged gameplay mechanics but even those issues aside, the game still holds up surprisingly well.",
"The only thing that redeems this game from total mediocrity is the multiplayer, and the more people you have (up to four) the better. Like Mario Party, it&#146;s nearly pointless to play alone, but gets more fun with a group and a case of beer.",
"Shadowbane has jolted much-needed new life into the massively multiplayer genre - a genre that was showing every sign of being drowned in a flood of derivative games. It's a brave attempt at something new, and it succeeds. [July 2003, p.70]",
Fallen Legion: Sins of an Empire is a unique experience that presents a fun yet challenging combat system with great animations and a world where every decision you make affects the kingdom around you. It’s not perfect by any means but it succeeds more than it fails.,
"The comparison with College Football 25 could have been merciless for Madden NFL 25, but EA Orlando came out pretty well. To play it is arguably the best post-pandemic episode. Bringing it up to the level of the college football title requires fewer bugs, new ideas and a willingness to twist a winning formula.",
"A Space for the Unbound is an adventure game that stands out for its absolutely gorgeous art style and memorable plot that brings in a bag of difficult themes for the player to come into contact with. As far as its gameplay goes, this is a rewarding experience featuring a great amount of puzzles, but its pacing is not what most players would expect, and often it's possible to be facing too many redundant tasks. This means that seasoned adventure game fans will feel more at ease with A Space for the Unbound, whereas a broader segment of the public might be put off by the way the game advances.",
"A surprisingly fun little game that challenges you with some cool puzzles and sends you through a nicely lit, often-interesting mansion. Despite some problems with control and a little bit of an awkward camera, I was quite entertained most of the time.",
"Cities XL 2012 is an enjoyable and addictive city builder, but the lack of depth that makes it instantly accessible to newcomers also makes it less interesting to play in the long run. It is also disappointing that there's so few improvements and new features in this year's edition.",
"This atmospheric puzzler/platformer takes you to a 50s dystopia. Playing as a kid with a little brother puts boundaries on you to go wherever you want freely. Monochroma is a great first start for the studio, but brings nothing new to this genre.",
"Mugen Souls is a fun, fast-paced RPG with a goofy sense of humor and a million interlocking gameplay systems, and both makes fun of and feels like a throwback to a more traditional style of RPG. Ignore the character art and dive in - you'll have a great time converting the world to minion-hood.",
"Difficulty aside, I dug this game because a lot of the little touches: the shadows that fall on the track, the shortcuts, the elevation changes, and the way that every race and lap has some surprises in store. [March 2005, p.140]",
"150 playable characters, an absolutely nuts map editor, eleven online multiplayer types, a Challenge and Arcade mode; the list goes on for this refreshing spin on the borderline ho-hum first-person shooter genre.",
"Thunder Blade is well done arcade port with lots of options that help to modernize the experience. Like most other old arcade games, personal interest is really what drives the game’s value. For players who either remember the arcade original or simply enjoy the style, it’s definitely worth checking out.",
"The Incredibles game had some great material to work with, but the energy and humor that really made the movie great just isn't there - out-of-context voice clips and poorly connected cut-scenes certainly don't add anything. [Jan 2005, p.132]",
"Sega tries to breathe new life into the stale Sonic franchise with this racer, but sadly forgot to rev up the overly simplistic gameplay and slim selection of modes and characters.",
"Combat can be fatiguing rather than stimulating, and frustrations are plentiful. But underneath it all is a game with potential, influenced by an assortment of classics. Hunt the Night, but only if you are tolerant and can forgive some conspicuous imperfections.",
"The graphics are fair, but like the fighting, they grow redundant too quickly, and the story couldn't get the game noticed even if it were drunk, topless, and the only woman in a bar full of sailors.",
"Dead Cells is a pure gem, and it comes close to perfection. Top notch game design and super reactive playability are what will make you feel like playing it again and again, until death do you part.",
"I’m still marking Concord fairly high, as it’s a fun shooter with solid online play that I’ve really enjoyed playing, and look forward to continuing with throughout the year. I hope that the ship can be righted so the game has a chance to really come to life, and I’d like to see what the devs have planned for future modes, characters and so on, but at the same time it’s hard to suggest anyone drop $40 on a game that feels like it may be destined for heavy discounts, or even go free-to-play, in the near future. If you’re absolutely itching for a new hero shooter to check out, I definitely think you can have some fun with Concord, but if you’re still on the fence, you might be better off waiting just a bit longer to see how or if Concord can overcome its rocky launch.",
"Morteshka’s second outing was a home-run. Black Book is a superbly written title, lifting the lids of a host of Slavic myths that were likely unknown to many of us previously. Gameplay can be easy at times, but the rest will keep you locked in.",
"Loop Hero succeeds as an adventure game by blending together elements of strategy and roguelikes in a way that feels clever and fresh. Giving players agency on the adversaries they encounter, and the frequency of said encounters, is an exciting spin on the genre, and one that forced me to strategize in a unique way. Couple the outstanding mechanics with a gorgeous and well-executed visual design, and you’ve got yourself one satisfying gameplay loop.",
"Warhammer: The End Times – Vermintide is a cheap and tasty Left 4 Dead-shaped snack. The center’s filled with smooth and deliciously hard action, and on the outside there’s a refreshing level design. The ideal co-op experience – one that rarely tries anything new, yet due to its excellent finish Vermintide could turn out to last as long as Left 4 Dead itself.",
"The best parts of Payday 2 and Left 4 Dead in the gritty Warhammer fantasy universe, with a heavy emphasis on melee combat and loot. There’s tons here for co-op fans, and the emphasis on melee makes it stand out from the rest of the pack.",
"While the control limitations and simple combos will have you weary of the single-player modes in a couple days, the never-ending blood and neat three stance system will make kicking your friends' asses all the more enjoyable.",
"Revita is a truly inspired and interesting roguelike, characterized by a very pleasant pixel art and a valuable soundtrack. However, what really stands out about this game is the focus on the peculiar balance between upgrades and health, and also the many enemies and different bosses you'll encounter during each run.",
"While War Chest could've used better matchmaking with player match-ups and a little more variety with battle missions, it's still a fun trip through kiddie nostalgia, especially if you double down on the Hall of Fame Edition and pit G.I. Joe against He-Man. I mean, who doesn't want to see that battle happen?!",
"What pleasantly surprised me about Hudson Soft's effort is its sense of difficulty. It doesn't wimp out on making the player work through a stage several times before picking up on the timing of the jumps, what order to kill the enemies and the like.",
"Button City gets a lot right in its attempt to mesh late 90s low-poly style with narrative adventure gameplay and a heartfelt story full of great characters, but it's undone by numerous and often game-breaking bugs and a tad too much backtracking.",
"I can safely recommend NBA 2K23 to every sports games fan, even though the microtransactions are extremely aggressive. The gameplay is too good, and I hope future updates won’t break it.",
"The game feels more like a boss-rush version of a big action game that it does a traditional fighter, and somehow comes off as the best 3D Castlevania game Konami has produced so far. [Jan 2009, p.110]",
"If you’ve been ignoring Thunder Blade for the past quarter-century, it’s time to take notice. 3D Thunder Blade is not just a great arcade port- it’s one of the best pick-up-and-play action games on the 3DS.",
"Alwa’s Legacy makes its art style and level design its best assets. Fun, charming and very solid gameplay-wise, this is a great choice if you’re looking for a experience with a retro vibe.",
Decades of sub-par copycats haven’t dulled the appeal of Puzzle Bobble and while there’s too few new ideas this is an effective reboot for what remains a classic match-three puzzler.,
"Top-down hitman, that's what this stealth game feels like. It's fun, definitely when you're playing it with a friend, which makes the mediocre graphics and clumsy controls a bit easier to digest.",
"Between wonder-filled stages and mini segments of mine cart riding and flying, there’s plenty in Klonoa Phantasy Reverie that feels familiar, but fresh. The collection naturally evokes a purer time in gaming where simplicity was key, and loveable mascots were trendy. While Klonoa was never the mainstream success it aimed to be, this remaster is the perfect opportunity for the franchise to dazzle a whole new audience.",
"Neon White is a truly unique first-person action experience. With its clever level design and Soul Card system, chaining together demon-slaying and platforming to get to the goal the quickest is a breeze. The game’s compelling cast and setting draw you into its story, and the wealth of side content and drive to improve on one’s scores will keep you coming back. Even its sluggish boss fights and somewhat samey visual style doesn’t do much to hold the game back. If you are looking for a truly unique indie action title, you should definitely check out Neon White.",
"The devilish tracks and quick, pick-up-and-play nature of the mission structure result in a game that is perfectly suited for the PSP console, and gamers looking for something a little different could certainly do a lot worse.",
"There is something to be gained from Target Liberty, and if you do enjoy the likes of Commandos it may be worth your time. For anyone else though, this sloth of a game will likely be far too lumbering and largely thrill free.",
"Call of Juarez does a fascinating job of blending an epic period in history with an already proven gaming genre. It strays here and there, but it is the overall experience that Techland set out to provide, which I feel they have succeeded at tremendously.",
"The Settlers: New Allies tries to reinvent the series, simplifying its city-builders core mechanics to make room for newcomers more familiar with the RTS genre. Unfortunately, the final shape is a game that struggles to find its identity and that isn't really convincing neither as an RTS nor as a city-builder.",
"LaserLife is terrific, though quite brief. It’s filled with wonderful sights and sounds that build into a memorable expedition into the universal human experience. Despite its lack of length — and some irritating technical issues — it’s a tremendously fun and memorable adventure that stays with you long after its sounds have faded away.",
"If you are trying to ween a GF (or BF, never let it be said GR isn't progressive) on to modern consoles, this could be a great stepping stone, as the gameplay and graphics are just as simple as they were back in the day. But if you're a hardcore, experienced gamer, you may want to skip Blade Kitten in favor of playing with other pussycats.",
"Ankh doesn’t play host to a menagerie of well-thought out, mind-bending puzzles. If anything, Deck 13 plays it safe in this regard; yet, the sheer playability of it all: the satisfying gameplay, quirky characters and rousing visuals ensures that Ankh is a worthy recipient of our praise.",
"The action and plot are both intense and well-woven, as well. The cutscenes are lengthy and numerous, but don't really wow you. And the weird distortion of reality heralds back to a much-missed adventure hey-day where the plot mattered more than simply looking pretty.",
"The thrill of taking control of the family in action is soon soured by some nasty control and camera glitches, but youngsters who can't get enough of seeing Mrs Incredible stretch herself around won't really care about the finer points of directional play.",
"Madden NFL 25 truly does make some improvements over Madden NFL 24. That said, it is hard to give the game a glowing review when it isn’t even the best football game EA Sports has released this Summer. Anyone loyal enough to the Madden franchise to pick up the new version each year will definitely be pleased with Madden NFL 25, but the game isn’t a must-have by any metric.",
"Hard West II, just like the predecessor, is the living proof that there’s life after XCOM too. Although the game could do with a bit more weapons, in between the multiple abilities and poker cards system, it offers enough variation to warrant a full playthrough. If you’re a fan of turn-based strategy games, Hard West II is a no brainer. The game does what it sets out to do, despite lacking deeper RPG elements and some balancing issues. I also loved the voice-acting and the overall presentation of the game. I’d like to see more of the latter in small budget titles, it shouldn’t be that hard to achieve. Play this if you love XCOM, but don’t play it like XCOM!",
"If the mini-games were easier to play, and there were more of them, paired with an adventure mode that wasn't quite such a throwaway piece of gameplay, this would be a really good title.",
"When it comes to games, you’ll rarely find yourself saying: ‘’Let your expectations run wild, for they will surely be met with excellence’’. Rebirth feels more like a spectacular conclusion than a midway point of a trilogy. Bursting with content, rare are the moments where you won’t feel the utmost joy. It is easily one of the best Final Fantasy games ever conceived and one of the greatest titles this genre has to offer. A true masterpiece that makes us excited for what the series will have to offer next.",
"What I’m left with is a passable, extremely repetitive game that offers up brief bursts of catharsis muddled in a misguided sea of queasy colors, and all wrapped up in a convoluted and uncompelling plot.",
"The Thaumaturge is a conflicting game. It beautifully depicts an alternative history and Warsaw in 1905. However, the main character is challenging to connect with, and his story feels a bit hastily put together. Despite this, individual stories offer quality entertainment and tough moral choices. The Salutors are excellently rendered graphically, and their abilities in combat are enjoyable. If only the combat itself were better balanced, and the encounters were designed to have some narrative sense. Nevertheless, the overall game is entertaining; you just need to overlook some imperfections.",
"The Lord of Terror has never looked so good, with Diablo II: Resurrected taking the original, and improving its look so as to present it to a whole new generation of gamers, or to those who are still in love with the 2000 classic by Blizzard North. There's not much here in the way of additions or changes, which is definitely a wasted opportunity to practically offer the best ARPG ever made, but it's still hard to say no to such a devilishly good remaster. Good job Blizzard. Finally.",
"For reasons unknown to us, Commandos: Origins turned out to be a very archaic game that feels drawn out, terribly linear and incredibly tedious. Don't forget about a bunch of bugs.",
"Blade Kitten turns out to be an amusing game but it doesn't manage to leave a strong impression. You might enjoy the first play through but after that the game will just lie there, collecting dust.",
"For some unknown reason Activision took a pretty respectable franchise (I still play SoF2 from time to time to this day, and it is still installed on my PC), and chucked it in the garbage.",
"The play and story will ring familiar to anyone who&#146;s played the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series&#151;which is good&#151;but the guy responsible for the crummy graphics should slip on a pair of cement galoshes and take a long walk off a short pier.",
"The thing to remember is that this will be Rocksteady Studios’ last entry into the Batman Arkham universe, so if you have been playing the previous entries in the series, and enjoyed them, this is going to be a no-brainer, just go get it.",
"South of Midnight may not be a standout in the gameplay department, but the dazzling art style, interesting world building and fearless storytelling more than make up for it. Games Pass continues their recent string of successful launches with another great title, bravely exploring themes of trauma, healing and empathy in a refreshingly unique new setting.",
"Trek To Yomi will set you back the price of a cinema ticket, but guarantees more spectacle than you’ll find in most big-screen ventures. A killer combination of stylish swordfights and thought-provoking storytelling, Trek To Yomi should be high on your list of games to play this year.",
"The world is beautifully rendered and is capable of giving a wide variety of thematic maps and the capability to drill down into any region. The sun and moon rotate around the earth, as mankind moves steadily forward below, all creating a great mood and setting for the game.",
"The storyline is as good as - if perhaps better than - ""Warcraft 3"" in parts, and the various multiplayer modes and the strategy of the different sides combined with the various gods add up to a good deal of longevity.",
"The result is an addictive experience thanks to its simple, but effective concept based on increasing power and replayability. If we would have liked a little more variety in the level objectives, the challenge overcome manages to make us forget this pitfall. In short, an ideal reason to relaunch Splatoon 3.",
"If the story had a bit more humour, if the gameplay wasn't so jerky and the action so hard to control, if the graphics had a little extra polish on them and if the sound wasn't so bad, it may have been a great port.",
"Congratulations, Wii owners! While Xbox 360, PS3, and PC owners are enjoying the latest chapter of Brothers in Arms in high definition, you get to relive the glory of the first two games in this buggy, ugly-as-hell port that eliminates the multiplayer and sabotages the single-player campaign with frequent stutters and framerate issues.",
"With Lumines: Electronic Symphony, the series grows and expands in ways that render prior games as more spin-offs than true sequels. It reinvents itself for a new medium and showcases Sony's new handheld, just as its predecessor managed in 2005. Mark our words: you will remember why you loved this game so much.",
"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron offers a lot of fun, but has some minor issues. The campaign is varied and compelling, but has some rough edges and misses a cooperative multiplayer mode. The multiplayer is unique and fun, but misses a deeper layer to keep you entertained longer.",
"It runs smooth, looks great, features tight controls and an arcade sense of physics that lets anyone get a handle on it in a couple of minutes. The fact that it's challenging and deep leaves room for gamers to develop their skills, both physical and mental, over time.",
"Total War: Troy makes some curious changes to the Total War formula, but the less streamlined resource system, extra micromanagement, and weird mix of reality and mythology work against its favour to create a less than entrancing experience.",
The old-school masterpiece Guardian Heroes touches the heart of every nostalgic gamer and so far. A full action rpg based game that still brings to you all the Treasure's craziness: just love it!,
"It's not going to set the world alight like Gears of War and it doesn't revolutionise survival horror like Resident Evil 4, but its thrilling combat and sensational visuals make it well worth adding to your collection.",
"Onimusha: Warlords is short, and the remastered version doesn't expand with any new playable content. But it does a good job in terms of improving graphics performance and control. What's more, even in 2019, the battle system is still gorgeous, and it definitely is a must-buy game for the fans.",
"Less enjoyable is the amazingly blatant product placement&#151;bike brands like Trek and Specialized make sense, but while you pedal, billboards for online auction sites and energy bars peddle under the guise of earnable sponsorships. Gamers will tire of it quickly.",
"Despite minor complaints and moments of awkwardly forced titillation that nearly wreck its somber and engrossing atmosphere, Last Light proves exhilarating, haunting, and one of the best-looking games ever.",
"How would it be if we could put together Hearthstone and The Binding of Isaac in just one game? BetaDwarf’s Forced Showdown is the answer, and a very solid, surprising and original one. A title full of content that can provide any player a great amount of fun through the dozens of hours you can spend with it.",
"Kudos to Nintendo for giving us a glimpse of how things would be on the flip side of the world, with Peach saving the day for a change...even if she's crying or storming through it.",
"Despite its immediate beauty, After Us doesn’t generate the emotional response I would hope for from a title in this genre. Perhaps if it were a bit shorter and more focused, I would have been more motivated to explore and rescue every spirit. Instead, the unpolished platforming and surplus of unnecessary collectibles diluted its intensity. Though there are certainly some memorable moments here, there are simply other titles in the genre that are much more successful at doing what After Us is attempting to accomplish.",
"Onimusha brings back one of the greatest PS2 adventures. Visuals (remastered in 16:9 format and 1080p resolution) and combat system are still ok, but some mechanics feel outdated. It brought back our best memories of the 2001 original PS2 game.",
"Killer Is Dead is a competent, and oftentimes superb, action title that is held back by an overly obtuse plot and a dating minigame that did more to turn me off from the game entirely.",
"There are genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack and voiceovers are some of the best I've heard in a game for a long time, but that doesn't stop the action from being hackneyed and predictable.",
"Fun can be had with many of the games in Summer Sports Paradise Island, especially when playing head-to-head, but the control issues will keep you from that “just one more game” feeling present in titles like Wii Sports.",
Too much too fast too same. Race On is maybe an acceptable add-on to the legendary Race – The WTCC Game but without the handful of new cars and tracks you end up playing the same game again. [Issue#187],
"The Wii U needs more games like Lego City Undercover. Is far from being a revolution or be remembered as a classic, but is guaranteed to give many hours of fun to those who give it a chance.",
"Ikenfell doesn't need an extra push to make its narrative more touching and well-timed, especially atop its unique mechanics and gorgeous art. Throughout the game, players are shown how everyone's relationships change each other. It meditates on the idea that these relationships serve to strengthen and ground them all as the ever-changing seasons of life bring about uncertain situations. What message could be more apt amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which has affected much of 2020.",
"Unfortunately the only thing that differentiates Kill Team from other twin-stick shooters is the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The game is very short and you can find fault in its every element. [August 2011, p.72]",
"The Devil's Daughter is a collection of minigames sewn together with a very questionable story, but that manages to keep the player amused for the duration of the game. Particularly given the atmosphere crafted in every detail of London and the deduction mechanics, the game will often make you feel like Sherlock.",
"Piccolo Studios has once again managed to take something dark, desolate, and painful and find the beauty in it. After Us is a haunting tale of humanity's atrocities against the planet that hits closer to home than most people would want to accept. The game's mesmerising imagery haunted me at times and at other times had me in awe with its gorgeous vistas and art direction. It may be a simply platformer but it has a power message that everyone should pay attention to.",
"It just doesn't seem confident enough to let itself be the thing it is, and this manifests itself in a reward structure that stops short of demanding the most of you, and in lots of tangential fodder that dilutes its purposefulness.",
"Its old school style brings back lots of fond memories, and the huge amount of missions means that you'll be playing this game for a long time. While it's not as feature-packed as its big brothers, GTA Advance is a great stocking stuffer.",
"The game's a bit short and doesn't provide much beyond the visceral glee of running over craploads of people who actually have it coming, but that's probably more than enough for the lean, $10 price tag.",
If you enjoyed the original Diablo or Diablo II when it first came out… this is a great way to play it on a modern system without having to jump into a DOS box or wrestle with other settings to get it to work. If you like the idea of a loot clicker then grab a copy because this is a great example of it.,
"What could have been a messy title merely created to showcase the Unigine Engine has turned out to be a surprisingly polished and deep strategy game. Oil Rush isn't just a joy to behold in action, but manages to make an old genre feel fresh while looking the part.",
"Shovel Knight Showdown builds on the legacy of the series and even adds to it a story/campaign mode, something worthy of praise. Anyone looking for intense, fun hours with friends has something here that will please everyone, thanks to the use of its different gameplay mechanics and game rules.",
"Overall, Kung Fu Rabbit is a bit of a surprise. We didn’t expect much from it at first glance but this is a really good effort from the development team. Controls are intuitive and slick, and the game world is bright and charming. It’s a thoroughly enjoyable platform game that really deserves attention from Wii U owners and it looks great on the gamepad as well.",
"Other problems include a strange sense of physics where you can push or slide other vehicles away from you, intensely aggressive pedestrians and gang members who swarm like bees, and frustrating timed races that will have you contemplating whether or not you should use your GBA as a Frisbee.",
"I was pleasantly surprised at just how good Guardian Heroes wound up being. The original game's gameplay has held up really well even if its graphics haven't, and the remixed version is outstanding.",
"Ikenfell is a charming little turn-based tactical RPG that hooks you in quickly with a well-written story and strong cast of characters and keeps you locked in for its duration with a surprisingly complex combat system. There are accessibility options here to suit all levels of player, a good idea considering how tough some of the battles can be along the way, and, overall, this is a heart-warming and unique entry to its genre that comes highly recommended.",
"Challenging but without the same painstaking depth as most fighting games, Griefhelm neatly distils the thrills of facing your opponent in a mortal melee. The campaign has some clever ideas to help extend longevity with multiplayer being a welcome addition, though the core gameplay can grow repetitive after a while. Still, it's a fun take on the genre and one that will hopefully grow and galvanise over time.",
"From the look of the graphics to the general feel of the gameplay, we've seen this before -- with the exception of the track editor. But it's not really enough to make the game stand out from the rest of the pack.",
"Alwa’s Legacy is a sequel done right. It improves on its formula in every conceivable way. There are a couple of frustrations in terms of combat and guidance, but overall this is a stellar Metroidvania from a dedicated and passionate developer.",
"An epic RPG quest that rewards patience. It's slow-paced, but once you're strong enough to tackle the bigger monsters it really shines. Just don't expect anything ground-breaking. [June 2006, p.81]",
"My favorite gaming experiences are the ones that elicit a pure and physical response from me. Whether it’s a horror game making me clench my cheeks or a story-driven game dropping my jaw and pulling a tear from my eye, those kinds of experiences are the ones that stick with me the most. With Pikuniku, I was smiling and laughing throughout the entire thing, and too few games get that kind of response out of me. Pikuniku is a treasure of a game, and I can’t wait to see more from this team.",
"Overall the game feels like just an average entry in a crowded puzzle game market, not just with the smartphone games Minis on the Move feels like it is emulating, but on the 3DS as well.",
"Riptide is full of the juddering frame-rate, buggy environments and unwieldy frame-rate, buggy environments and unwieldy collision detection that plagued its predecessor; it makes it feel and handle like a very long piece of DLC. [Issue#135, p.110]",
"Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star is a game made of highs and lows. Its indisputable merits counteract an equally large number of defects, which make the purchase only recommended to fans of the Fate series.",
"In one of the trailers for Concord, the character Lennox says an interesting phrase: ""Coming close to death is the best way to learn how not to die."" In its release week, the game has clearly reached the ""near death"" stage. Now it's up to the Firewalk team to fulfill their prophecy, or suffer like so many other games in the hero shooter genre.",
"You also don't feel particularly bloodthirsty when you've got this bouncy music playing in the background. The music just isn't that good in general. It's dull and repetitive...Aside from some gripes here and there, FF:VR is a well done adventure game.",
"As someone who hasn’t played Shovel Knight since the original release, I found Showdown to be a very good return. It’s grown on me quite a bit, and if you’re a fan of competitive or co-op multiplayer games this could be considered a must. While offering less for the solo player, I’m confident the gorgeous pixel art, wealth of options, and unlockables will still prove satisfying.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an exceptional sequel that surpasses expectations in nearly every aspect. It combines compelling storytelling, innovative combat, and a wealth of engaging content to deliver an unforgettable adventure. As a bold continuation of the saga, it sets the stage for the final installment, leaving fans eagerly awaiting what comes next. Square Enix has truly outdone itself, showcasing the depth and potential of the Final Fantasy VII universe.",
"Hydroventure: Spin Cycle is a fresh puzzle game, whose many uses of water never ceases to entertain, despite some bad turns from time to time. The game has a steady progression and clever puzzles which keep your mind constantly occupied, while not being overly complex, thus making for an overall rewarding experience.",
"Yet, even with newly included character classes, new gameplay features and a cleaner online system, the fact still remains that Return To Arms is a title with relatively few advancements within the formula.",
"Trek to Yomi feels like a victim of its own cinematic inspirations and artistic ambitions. While satisfying at times, the combat is ultimately pretty one-note and begins to outstay its welcome by the time you’ve reached the end of Hiroki’s journey. I’m a sucker for artistically driven indie experiences, but there’s got to be some strong gameplay forming a foundation for it, and I can’t say I overly enjoyed my time accompanying Hiroki on his quest for vengeance.",
"It is a powerful and emotionally driven tale that features an incredibly clever structure that is far more intelligent than anyone really gave it credit for at the time. It’s equally intriguing and unsettling spending time in this bizarre version of Hyrule, with characters you have met before…but are different, here.",
"For fans of horses, racing, stats, or high functioning autistics this title stocks plenty to do. Tack on decent graphics and challenging (but not impossible) learning curve and you've got one satisfying niche title and a surprisingly great and wicked way to get your pony fix.",
"Omen of Sorrow tries to deliver a compelling fighting game with multiple characters from horror stories and movies. Unfortunately, the game does not succeed. It has too few characters, is way too easy and it is simply too slow.",
"Dead or School provides a surprisingly long side-scrolling action campaign that’s sure to please fans of Castlevania-style games, especially those who’ve grown tired of countless retro-graphic homages. The action is tight, the story is fun, and the rewards are big.",
"Drakensang is interesting and can keep you glued to your seat, but its replay value isn’t quite as high as it could have been and the sometimes overzealous difficulty can be a turn-off for newcomers.",
"I’m not sure if more time in the oven is the answer to The Waylanders’ problems, but it couldn’t hurt. I really liked the setting and core story, but I’m afraid that the game’s bland combat and awkward controls are baked in by now. It has character, charm and style to spare but swings and misses in the execution. The Waylanders is a collection of really good ideas, almost none of which are allowed to shine without compromise.",
"Beyond Eyes is an art showcase – beautiful to behold, undoubtedly – but I dreaded the majority of my time playing it. Unless you need to know what happens to a stray cat, don’t feel guilty for keeping Beyond Eyes in your blind spot.",
But what really blew me away was the inclusion of a cool and intuitive (if limited) map editor and the online facilities for players to trade their works of art amongst one-another easily and efficiently.,
"Overall, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition lives up to its name. The changes are almost universally for the better by taking an excellent game and smoothing out the faults, flaws, and weak points while providing additional content. Considering Xenoblade Chronicles was one of the best JRPGs of the last console generation and arguably one of the best JRPGs of all time, this improves upon an already outstanding title. Fans of the original and newcomers alike should find Definitive Edition a wonderful way to experience Xenoblade Chronicles at its best.",
"One of the most refreshing games to come out of Nintendo in a while...It's a great adventure indeed, but when the 30 days are over and the last level is complete you find yourself feeling somewhat slighted.",
"It's amazingly accessible for young players, features a proactive character for girls, and is a great way to introduce children to the adventure genre. And although long-time gamers will find the game to almost run on automatic, it also features a fast-paced crime story with surprise twists, and some smooth art.",
"So it's not for multiplayer fans or story fans or innovation fans, but Dark Sector is certainly a good game. When it all comes together and you're ducking in and out of cover while shooting and throwing the Glaive at groups of enemies, it's a lot of fun, and the visual spark and A.I./pacing/combat polish make it worth playing.",
Shadowrun Chronicles isn't just a bad Shadowrun game. It's a bad game. That it comes from a series with such an exceptional pedigree and plenty of exceptional recent successes just makes the disappointment that much more bitter.,
"By offering a whole heap of challenging encounters, fun roguelite mechanics, and just another reason to jump into one of the Switch's best games, Splatoon 3: Side Order is a thrill. More boss fights would've been nice, but that doesn't take away an unshakeable desire to jump back in right now.",
"Ultimately, Hellbound isn't going to leave a sour taste in any player's mouth, but that's only because it leaves no taste at all. It's a bland retread of a bygone era of gaming that has no understanding of why people want to return to it. Hellbound carelessly mashes up concepts and mechanics with no thought and no craft, creating an end product that's serviceable only because of the strength of its foundation. Fighting demons with a shotgun is fun. It always was fun, and it always will be fun, and there's nothing wrong with Hellbound's interpretation of that. It's just that there are a thousand other games that do all this so much better, so it's hard to see why anyone would pick up this particularly shotgun.",
"At first glance, Tinykin might appear overwhelming with its various tinykin mechanics and the collectibles to find, but somehow, the game keeps you moving at a steady but still entertaining pace. At its bare minimum, you will still get at least six hours of fun trying to get Milo home. However, decide to go full completionist, and you can add a couple of hours to the total playtime and more satisfaction from solving tougher puzzles. And while it may not necessarily have that strategic component of Pikmin, Tinykin makes the most of its take on the genre while adding its own adorable mascots for one of the best 3D platformers in recent years, especially on Game Pass.",
"It’s not often you write over 1,000 words and have virtually nothing bad to say about a game, but that’s Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. It’s a masterpiece, a work of art, bonafide breathtaking brilliance.",
"It's the perfect, brutal antidote to more complicated fighters like Tekken, but it's also complex enough to satisfy those put off by the stupidity of previous games. Bloody great. [Playstation 2 Max]",
"Frustrating at the beginning, after a little while we'll get used to the gameplay mechanics and then, we will be able yo enjoy this puzzle game. It's quite entertaining and challenging, and thus, recommended for those looking for this kind of experiences on 3DS.",
"A realistic flight sim. Sometimes realistic games can drive people away, which is what Aero Elite did for me. Most of the time I was doing nothing but trying to get in range of my target, then shot a missile.",
"If you are thinking about the content of the game while you are working, it’s an addictive game and definitely recommended to those who have enjoyed the franchise up to this point.",
"It's a niche game, as all Slitherine projects are, but the publisher does have a deep understanding of what makes for a quality, deep, strategy game, and it has applied the same expertise to the tactics sub-genre with impressive results.",
The game is as hollow as the sentiments behind it. More attention should have been paid to the innerworkings of the game rather than securing the toy rights and shopping the concept around to make a major motion picture.,
"Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is much bigger, more ambitious and complete as a video game than Remake was. But its great virtue is its courage to look ahead, to be clear about its path and to bet on it with an outstanding display in all its areas. With Rebirth, a new legend in the history of games is born.",
"Almost exactly what we wanted it to be. Story mode and single-player antics are diverting enough but the game excels in multiplayer, offering fast-paced thrills that only the highlights of the ""Unreal"" series can really contest. [March 2005, p.122]",
"It's like a new paint job for a car you've been driving for years, it shines and smells fresh, but it's a highly familiar experience. However, Rush and FC IQ are novelties that deserve high praise in this mission to please Greeks and Trojans.",
RRR2 has taken all the charm and thoughtful originality of the first game and reduced it to a catatonically simple formula that even the most ardent fan will find hard to enjoy for longer than a few hours.,
"I would not recommend this for too many teenagers and below, because the action is more slowly paced and more emphasis is placed on technical specs of your ship than graphical wizardry during the battles.",
"Ideal if you're looking for a game with rather more challenge than other recent RTS offerings. The single-player levels should offer a stiff trial to just about everyone, and the skirmish AI, on the higher difficulty settings, puts up a hell of a fight.",
"The combat and weapons are fun and the levelling systems keep things interesting and give an air of replayability to the title if your Xbox is starting to get a little dusty. If we see a third instalment though, the game needs to step up a little to keep up with the competition.",
Monster Hunter Freedom is an improved experience over its PS2 single player counterpart but you won't get the most out of the game until you can find some hunting buddies and really give the multiplayer a proper workout.,
"Sonic Colours is the best 3D Sonic since the Adventure iterations on the Dreamcast. Beautiful, nicely cinematic and with spectacular gameplay and level design, Sonic Colours is a big step in the right direction for the blue hedgehog. The Sonic Team was able to draw inspiration from the latest plumber's adventures from Nintendo to give new momentum to their character, and it's both a satisfaction and a relief to play with him again in such a satisfying way.",
"I have no doubt that Throne and Liberty will find a niche in the MMO community that it somehow speaks to. And I’m happy for those people that they will find something to enjoy here. But for most players, I don’t think Throne and Liberty will have anything valuable.",
"Super Princess Peach is a forgiving and entertaining slice of a game that’s at its most successful when it evokes the same feeling as a two-dimensional Mario. [Christmas 2005, p.103]",
"If you are a complete bike racing fanatic I've got no doubt in my mind that the sheer excitement of racing around the track will be reason enough to warrant the price tag of TT Superbikes. For everybody else, this just isn't good enough to keep you interested.",
"Throne and Liberty is at its core an old-school player-versus-player MMO with a defined focus on world and large-scale group combat. While graphically stunning, an average combat system and a potentially divisive monetization model hold back this otherwise extremely competent MMORPG.",
"The game is fun and offers a very interesting narrative approach. I thoroughly enjoyed each of the stories in the overall plot, and I found the gameplay more than captivating, although certain of the protagonist's abilities could certainly have been better utilized.",
"Yar's Revenge is a bold, daring and ambitious reinvention of a classic franchise, but one that's ultimately difficult to recommend over the competition. It's a competent on-rails shooter - and a beautiful one at that. However, with shoddy controls, repetitive combat and no online multiplayer, Yar's Revenge isn't quite worthy of the game's 800-point asking price.",
"Rollerdrome is one of the most unique combo-building games in years. Its combination of Tony Hawk-style skating with Max Payne-esque gunplay is a joy to play. Nailing combos while taking down a swath of diverse enemies does feel nice, even if it does get a bit overwhelming at times. Plenty of players will find a ton of challenges in repeat playthroughs of levels to achieve everything, and will assuredly be able to pull off some sweet moments. Unfortunately, I ended up being pretty terrible at the game; but it’s hard to deny that Rollerdrome is something special.",
"Irritating though they may be, few of these problems would be insurmountable in the face of an engaging narrative. But like countless other pretty games trading on emotion, Röki drones on about feelings, namely grief—all of it documented in Tove’s illustrated journal, and complete with occasional asides about Dead Mom or Sad Dad. Repressed memories, shadow selves, and mysterious environmental sicknesses rear their tired heads. Beyond the trappings of Scandinavian myth, there’s precious little to set Röki apart in an already overcrowded space.",
"Unquestionably the definitive version of Team Ninja’s flamboyant fighter, Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate repurposes the panache of its predecessor – and pops a glazed cherry on top. The gameplay mechanics are still a smidgen shallow, and there may not be enough meaningful content to woo those that have already had their fill with the original release – but franchise fans and curious newcomers will find a competent option here.",
"Despite first appearances, Mini Motorways is a rewarding check-in with oneself rather than a simulation of traffic management and logistical network development. It’s a meditative simplification of city builders, like if Sim City was a bonsai that only needed the gentlest of tending, and maybe the occasional congestion-busting bypass.",
"While there are absolutely zero excuses for the missing multiplayer, I suspect Turok 2 might still draw a bit of a nostalgic audience on Nintendo Switch. Having a smoother, fogless experience (no $30 Expansion Pak needed) with modern touches like gyroscopic controls and a wealth of player options does help. But this game is uneven and dated, and it shows. Add in the cut multiplayer – I can’t stress that enough – and it makes Turok 2 just a so-so release on the Nintendo Switch.",
"The snow effects are unrivaled, the framerate is consistently high and the colors are vibrant. Add to that great animations (particularly during tricks) and an intense sense of speed, and you wind up with one of those rare games that can be as much fun to watch as to play.",
"Trek to Yomi is a fun enough five hours for the money. I wasn’t expecting Ghost of Tsushima for $19.99, so I wasn’t disappointed with what I got. However, I’m a big weeb, love Kurosawa, and think katanas are cool. I’m not sure if those unfamiliar with the design principle behind the game will understand where it’s coming from. It might serve as a gateway drug to Japanese cinema for some, but I think many people will just be wondering why it’s in black and white instead of color. Overall, it’s like a samurai with a dull sword: flashy, but lacking the razor edge needed to cut its way through the shadow of its contemporaries.",
"If you viewed the first Darksiders' borrowed gameplay beats as a potential sign of laziness from Vigil Studios, Darksiders 2 provides hearty evidence of a team with genuine skill and ambition. It doesn't always nail the pacing or polish, but Darksiders 2 adds so many valuable ideas to the series that a path to its future seems clear for the first time. For Darksiders, Death brings a much-needed spark of life.",
"Though it may show some ugly looks compared by of today's standards, when it comes to the highest levels of simulation, physics and playability, Simbin's 'Race On' simply delivers. Some may not like the steepy learning curve but this game is as close to reality as it can be.",
"Alan Wake's American Nightmare feels a bit spiritually out of step with the original Alan Wake, but provides just enough story to balance out the action. But, seriously, it needs more Barry.",
"Throne & Liberty has enormous potential, with a seductive world and universe, and above all a highly successful atypical gameplay. It's not for everyone, however, as it requires a substantial investment to fully enjoy what it has to offer. The cash-shop aspect also allows a little too much.",
"The game is as homogenous and unimaginative as a tabloid cover, and is as far past its prime as Billy Dee Williams. It’s still a decent RTS, but it wins with quantity, not quality, just like Colt 45.",
"Namco Museum doesn't have a new hidden gem to offer or gimmicks to reinvent classic titles, but what it does offer is an experience that brings the arcade home. Quality of life features like save states and hints have been added to negate archaic design frustrations, and an option to rotate the screen to look like an arcade cabinet is an ingenious addition bursting with charm. Pac-Man Vs.'s lack of online does stand out as a disappointment, but the collection's roster is strong enough to make up for it. With so many unique ways to interact with the Nintendo Switch, the arcade hasn't felt this alive in years.",
"This all may come across as overly harsh and a tad vindictive, but I really wanted to love this game. There's so many juicy elements in Valkyria Revolution that could have been molded into a truly wonderful experience, but all those pieces just never seemed to properly assemble. I appreciate that the designers tried something new with the combat, but trying to blend strategy RPG elements with a hack 'n' slash just didn't work in this case. If you're curious about the Valkyria franchise, my advice would be to pick up the HD remaster of the original Valkyria Chronicles. I can't speak for the two follow-up games released on the Vita, but I can say, with certainty, that Valkyria Revolution is not worth your time or money.",
"Although it could have been much better than it actually is, Final Fantasy XIII-2 proves to be a well-crafted product that compensates for gamers' disappointment over Final Fantasy XIII.",
"Offering slick, fast-paced gameplay, white-knuckle multiplayer, a lengthy single-player experience, and more B-movie cheese than a plate of microwave nachos, there’s a lot to like about Command & Conquer 3.",
"Wilson’s Heart for Oculus Rift is an absolute amazing VR gaming experience that harkens in tone and style to the old style classic films of Hollywood horror and the old Hammer Horror films. The presentation is even in black and white and lends its self-well to the adventure the player finds himself or herself thrust on. Furthermore, Wilson’s Heart is one of those diamonds in a sea of cannon fodder games for VR… not to say this diamond does not have a few flaws.",
"It’s the culmination of a very long development that presents itself as one of the first good surprises of the year. It doesn’t have the intention to innovate, especially when compared to Resident Evil 4, but its solid gameplay mechanics, alongside with some great visuals, make for a great experience. Especially for those who like visceral action. [Apr 2008]",
"Blending the momentum of an extreme sport with the action of a third-person shooter, Rollerdrome creates a unique experience that will resonate with those who love to chase a high score.",
"Here it is again, that good old Heroes feeling including the forget-about-time-syndrome and the just-one-more-level-excuses. We could write a lot more, but there's just that one battle to fight.",
"While RPG Maker Fes is not perfect, it is a fantastic leap into RPG game creation for newcomers. With its simplified toolset that does away with most of the programming features in order to allow for a streamlined system of creation, the simple act of building a world will still require patience and time. Fans of the series will find plenty to salivate over in this new game, and the thought of sharing their creations with users around the world, and in turn playing around in other created worlds, is what is going to give this game plenty of legs for many years. Though it does lack the ability to actually create original sprites and character or enemy portraits, it still provides enough presets to make some truly unique worlds and adventures. The only limitation is the creator's imagination.",
"If you are fan of Alan's painful journey, you've probably already downloaded this gem and know the greatness that continues to please fans again and again. If you have never played this title, I urge you to play the original to understand the story mode as this game does little to explain the past and expects you to already know the events that have happened.",
"The original Delta Force was cutting edge at the time and while Xtreme is a bit of a mission pack, it’s cheap and offers excellent offline and online gaming for under fourty bucks.",
"While Madden 25 feels like a great improvement on last year's game, it still feels like much of its core is standing in place. While that leads to a feeling of ""Maybe next year"" that the series has fostered before, it's definitely a better game than last year's effort.",
Playing Mini Motorways is as much a chance to enjoy the game’s puzzles as it is an opportunity to unwind and refocus. I went into Mini Motorways expecting a fun and quirky puzzle game and ended up finding so much more. The Steam release is definitely not one to ignore.,
"Digital distribution may never replace retail sales, and episodic content may never become the standard for all games, but the future of both is startlingly bright. Sin Episodes is among the first to fling itself into that future. Though common in its gameplay, it is also enjoyable: had it been ten bucks instead of twenty, I'd be raving.",
"If you’re really into the roguelike genre, you’ll enjoy this game. I can’t claim to have been blown away by it, but there were certainly some very cool moments during my playthrough and as this game won’t set you back a huge amount on Steam anyway, if you’re craving some retro, sci-fi action, you could do worse than Sword of the Stars: The Pit.",
"If you're not tired of seeing Gwent, it offers an enjoyable single player experience. Although its mechanics are not as complex as the original Gwent and Thronebreaker, its more simplified structure works in harmony with the Roguelike genre.",
"There are some good ideas in Heaven & Hell, but they rarely end up making for a fun game. Completing a mission feels more like work. Add a number of interface issues and plain old bugs, and you've got a pretty solid disappointment.",
"The Magic Obelisk has so many things going for it. It has really unique light-based puzzle game play, super cute graphics and characters, and a fantastic price tag. The clunky control does let the game down a bit, but I still think it's certainly worth your time and your $5.",
"Whatever it attempts, it generally does well, and where AI is concerned, moves to the head of the class. It lacks innovative imagination, but provides a solid gaming experience and a challenge that never fails.",
If you have even a sliver of child-like wonder left in your heart then playing Wattam is a must. Uncovering its exceptionally imaginative world as you interact with a diverse collection of oddities makes for one captivating and hilarious adventure.,
"The effervescent and copious presentation, the silly minigames, and the joy of shooting rainbows from a magic octopus to make a blissed-out cloud disappear (for example) make it worth taking Ash's giant wheel for a spin.",
"A glorified song pack it may be, but this is still as fun a party game as you're going find, one that revels in its own brilliant silliness and that's all but guaranteed to get the party started.",
"For puzzle fans, this is definitely an experience worth having. The puzzle modes have 32 to 44 levels each, many of them quite difficult, and ""Guide"" mode in particular is a whole lot of fun. However, there's no point in beating the same level twice, and the ""Create"" and ""Compose"" modes aren't captivating enough to add much replayability, so this is a game to rent, not buy.",
"If you’re looking for a real challenge in a great looking strategy game, then Soldiers is for you. However, the game can be so difficult that it will be just too much for the patience of most gamers.",
"It remains to be seen how this work will end with film number 2, which will be released next April, but for now, we have been delighted by Lost Records: Bloom & Rage. It offers a narrative adventure full of very charismatic characters, impeccable artistic design and a soundtrack used with skill at the most appropriate moments.",
"Assault Heroes 2 is a great shooter which may be added to the top of the Marketplace. The money you have to put into this game will be greatly rewarded. So if you are bored to death with the latest games, then Assault Heroes 2 will definitely brighten your day.",
"For a reasonably well-made, cheap, good-looking and great-sounding FPS based on a license &#145;inspired&#146; by the hit motion picture series, this &#147;MIB The Series&#148; game delivers the goods.",
"And in declining to make any kind of meaningful statement about its environmental themes, After Us only demonstrates that, like its protagonist, it has nothing to say for itself. [Issue#386, p.116]",
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is an enjoyable enough adventure, but it’s missing a hook to get players invested. The game wants you to get lost in the economy and exploration it offers, but in just performing these menial tasks for their own sake it fails to create any moments where the entire experience is more than a series of distractions.",
"Hats off for Remedy, who's made a daring move by releasing an Alan Wake game on Xbox Live. All our fears have been put to shame. This is the best Xbox Live Arcade game we've played yet.",
"Valkyria Revolution tries a lot of new things, but loses the Valkyria-soul in the process. The combat system is stuck between action and tactics and the style is completely different. It's only saved by an interesting story and beautiful soundtrack.",
"Unreliable performance and some underdeveloped mechanics do hurt the impact and atmosphere of After Us, but its intriguing post-apocalyptic world and satisfying movement still make for a worthy adventure.",
"Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is much better than its predecessor in all areas. The gameplay is well balanced, the duality of the gameplay works well and can give you reasons to play the game at least twice. The action is more intense, the scenery changes very frequently, and some sequences differ significantly from competition. Some players will find some choices limiting, such as the inability to use at will the cooperative actions, but we can assure you that the level of quality of the design and pressing action, tend to make you forget the substantial linearity.",
"Robocalypse is easily one of the best portable strategy games out there. It’s fun, has a nice sense of humor, and the simplified control scheme works well overall. If you can find friends with the game, you can battle in four-player action fests.",
"This is a fast musou game that you can enjoy whether you know the franchise or not. It's not something special within the genre, but if you understand its shortcomings and aspirations, you'll probably like it.",
"Dungeon Defenders: Awakened is an accumulation of the feedback and skills that this developer has received throughout the series. The gameloop of stopping hordes of enemies in their tracks just works, but if you’re a fan of the series, then you’ll be getting more of the same with this entry. Still, this is the most balanced and prettiest entry to date and a hell of a good time with friends. For that, I’m eager to see how the title grows post-launch.",
"While not a supremely inspired game, its limited premise is implemented so well from a technical and design standpoint that it's very easy to enjoy despite itself. [Mar 2007, p.56]",
"The story of Troy is still attractive nowadays, Total War: Troy combines it with the spirit of Total War series. As a result, it is indeed interesting but not so innovative or exceeding one's expectation.",
"Even if Close to the Sun offers a nice steampunk atmosphere and a worthy story, the basic gameplay and rudimentary puzzles are not enough to keep the player hooked long enough. Consider it during a strong sale.",
"The only major downside is the lack of online play. There could have been a lot of fun comparing how one uses their shovel or shield around the world. Because of that, Shovel Knight Showdown will probably only be enjoyed by core fans of the original game.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth codifies the long-lasting significance of JRPGs from the mid to late ’90s, an era in which developers finally had the tools to tell captivating sagas with little compromise. In 2024, Square Enix captures and recontextualizes 1997’s opus with an unyielding vision, building out its world and preserving it with a keen eye for how it fits into the modern landscape. With a cast of characters and a boundless world that has resonated with players for decades, that emotional core is not untouched, merely reborn.",
"Despite completely divergent gameplay and a very different art style, Ghost Trick feels like a creative extension of Ace Attorney; as though the team at Capcom is able to expand on the ideas in their flagship franchise, without being tethered to either those conventions or characters.",
A severely flawed game that could have been far better had it undergone further testing. The freeze bug is absolutely crippling and has even caused retailers like EBGames and GameStop to reduce the amount of money they'll offer for the game in trade-in value.,
"If you don't expect much from it, you'll have a pretty good time with Venetica. However, without the patience to figure out quests and gameplay elements on your own, you'll end up incredibly frustrated.",
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos is a delightful Zelda-inspired roguelite that's chock full of secrets, surprises, and some top-notch dungeon crawling action. There's an excellent central hub area to evolve and expand here, lots of fun little side quests to indulge in and a well-designed overworld that takes full advantage of your hero's ever-growing armoury of weapons, skills and gadgets. There are perhaps a few too many skill trees and upgrade mechanics for our liking and the story is entirely forgettable, but overall this one comes highly recommended for co-op and solo adventurers alike.",
"I was worried Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time would be a cheap cash grab, but I was wrong. There are some flaws, but the most important aspect — the franchise’s ethos — is fully intact and on full display, making this a game that’s sure to leave fans spellbound.",
"It offers up some solid improvement but doesn't stray too far from what made it so loved to begin with. It's not the groundbreaking title that the original was, but it's an excellent follow-up that delivers as promised.",
"Evotinction is a solid stealth adventure that explores what could happen if friendly AI assistants turned into deadly AI assailants. Take that idea and expand it into a facility once filled with just over 2,000 scientists, with one man determined to save the day for himself and everyone else, and you have a recipe for a fun time. It succeeds as an engaging narrative, atmosphere, and with having fun gameplay, making it an easy recommendation to anyone looking for something to scratch that stealth action itch. It is Metal Gear meets Watch_Dogs in the best way.",
"Think of King of Seas as yet another spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Pirates! It has all the tools needed to keep you entertained for many hours. Unfortunately, it's also lacking in certain departments, leading to a more streamlined approach that can't compare to the classic.",
"Although Outrun will always have a special place in my gaming heart, time has certainly moved on and even with enhancements the title struggles to really impress. Its main saving grace is the fact that Xbox Live Arcade is perfect for those quick 5-10 minute gaming sessions and OutRun fits the bill perfectly.",
"Acting more as a transition episode, Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 3 ""Fractured Mask"" is another great episode in the series, even if it isn't as fantastic as the first two. The tension is running high here and Telltale's writing is at the top of its game. If the last two episodes can live up to the first three this will easily go down as one of the developer's best.",
"Need for Speed Unbound is a great showcase for a new generation of hardware. Criterion has delivered a high quality, breathtakingly fast open-world street racer that is both technically superb and strangely familiar.",
"Ku's exploits clearly do not have the narrative balance of the Greek adventures, and do not add big variations to the gameplay formula, but they prove to be a solid and pleasant extension, a digression inside a very suggestive myth that deserves to be fully explored, waiting for the release of The Lost Gods, the last act of the Season Pass ready to lead us back to Ancient Greece.",
"Rather than preaching, Hotline Miami asks the questions and forces the player to confront the answers himself, without exculpating its own creators. That's the real mark of maturity.",
"If you are looking for something different or a game that can stimulate your mind, Metrico + is what you are searching for. The game has got an attractive design and it is simple and intuitive. The variety of puzzles and jump elements give the game an extra appeal. However, it does not offer many hours of play.",
"Easily the best in the series so far. It rejuvenates the formula, radically changing the game enough to make it a completely new experience, while at the same time retaining enough of the SSX formula to still satisfy the series’ faithful fans.",
"The addition of weapons and dark powers to Jak’s arsenal of attacks make combat more intriguing; however, the grandiose Haven City is quite the opposite, serving only as a presentation piece and an inhibitor to tackling the superb gameplay found in the missions.",
"Forza Horizon 5 [is] the first killer, can’t-miss game for the current generation Xbox Series X and S consoles as well as Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service. It’s a game that I think anyone can immediately find appealing.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is a marvel of a game and a standout title on the Xbox Series X. It’s a near-perfect racing and exploration game that looks stunning, plays like a dream, and just begs to be played over and over again.",
"Under the roguelite hood, Loop Hero serves as a perfect analogy of an everyday person's daily routine: wake up, face the obstacles, reach your (almost unattainable) goal, set a new goal, measure your losses. Rinse and repeat. Besides all that, Loop Hero is a stellar example of gameplay design ingenuity, meshing different elements in an addictive pixel-art nod to the 80s.",
The replay value for this title is huge and the amount of time that it's going to require to unlock everything is significant and will keep gamers glued to see what they can unlock next.,
"Playing alone is a tepid affair(even with create-a-clip Director Mode), and we would've liked meatier mini-games and more interactivity in general(waiting and watching are your primary actions), but this $70 package offers enough amusing antics and cheesy clips in it's four-player mode to warrant an audition at your next party or family gathering. [Jan 2009, p.75[",
"Chaotic action can be fun, but Fuel Overdose takes the concept too far. Local multiplayer would be an obvious highlight if it actually existed, but the lack of that and the sloppy controls, annoying camera and boring levels makes this game somewhat frustrating.",
"When Tesla fights with Edison, sparkles fly. An above-average story, perfect atmosphere and a decent pace. You will spend one great afternoon with the game despite its minor shortcomings. [Issue#304]",
"Absolute Power is a collection of small, but welcome enhancements--a splash of new content that doesn't change what the game is, but enough that anyone still investing hours in the perfect republic will love. [Sept 2010, p.84]",
"A thrilling and engaging experience. The swordplay is fun, and it's really fascinating to see the different spots where either Kojima's or Platinum's signature styles shine through. It also has a wild final confrontation that shows elements of both.",
"Sadly, this is a game that certainly does have the potential of being a worthwhile paintball title but falls short in so many ways that even shooter fans will be greatly disappointed.",
"Ever Forward is a captivating and emotionally charged puzzle adventure that doesn’t overstay its welcome with puzzle difficulty as it naturally evolves across each level. Following Maya through this mysterious world was made easy thanks to the environment designs, pacing, and overall accessibility. Aside from some stale story translations, Ever Forward is a great way to spend an evening.",
"Pulse is a victim of the Kickstarter craze. It had a unique idea and successful campaign, but failed to go anywhere meaningful from a gameplay standpoint. The music and visual style are redeeming factors, but the short length and uninspired mechanics (not to mention the brain scrambling acid trip sections) make Pulse an experience that feels unfinished and one I can’t honestly recommend.",
"If you want a hard-core and challenging game this isn't probably for you, but if you're looking for a good story to be lived as an interactive movie with great graphics and sound, this is surely a good buy.",
"Rainbow Skies is hampered by its weak narrative, overly tight economy, and sub-optimally tuned combat. What really kills it, however, is the vast amount of time it sucks up by forcing both the story and the combat to move at a snail’s pace. Rainbow Skies demands a ton of time from the player, but offers nothing of equal value to reward that investment.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is especially fun for players who like to tactically control the game thanks to a series of new options. In addition, the game has an enormously wide range with the introduction of a simulation mode and Rush. FC 25 still has some rough edges that prevent us from dealing with a championship-worthy selection.",
"SUPERHOT: Mind Control Delete feels like the full-length vision of the concept that was the original game. With more abilities, enemy types, levels, and lore, this is one of the easiest games to recommend for fans of the original.",
"You’d expect the first of a trilogy to be the most novel and at least as good as future instalments, but in this case we’re really hoping for a greater effort for the next outing. It’s worth noting that there’s no multiplayer and little replayability, but a Steam version of the original SiN has been bundled with it as a sort of bribe.",
"What BOXBOY! lacks in visuals and style, it makes up for with complex level design and intricate gameplay that will keep your brain churning for hours. It may not replace any of the bigger puzzle games out there, but HAL Laboratory’s little box opus brings some good, easily addictive puzzle entertainment.",
Its gameplay consists of bland beat-em-up action and imprecise gun control. The in-game visuals vary between good (up close) and bad (zoomed out) and the co-op options are limited and confusing.,
"While the story never fully grabbed me, Neon White is an absolute joy to play, keeping me hooked and repeatedly making me ask myself if I had one more run in me. Even if you’re not the sort of player who usually gets into chasing high scores and leaderboards, Neon White might surprise you.",
"Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games isn’t all that bad, but it’s not great either. The controls for a lot of the events are iffy at best, but there are events that are still enjoyable, especially the Dream Events. This is one where I’d check out the demo or rent it first to see if you like it before plunking down $50 for it.",
"Don’t Nod’s latest videogame arrives with the heavy responsibility of being Life Is Strange successor. However, rather than crumbling under the pressure of such a comparison, it confidently makes a serious attempt at overtaking its legendary predecessor. While Max Caulfield was a relatable character players could easily identify with, Swann is an incredibly powerful protagonist—her fears, anxieties, and dreams are deeply felt and effortlessly understood. This connection is so strong because, in one way or another, we have all been Swann at some point in our lives. Don’t Nod has crafted a story that strikes directly at the heart and soul of its audience, executing a true nostalgia-driven experience filled with countless references to 1990s pop culture. Lost Records: Bloom and Rage – Tape 1 is an undeniable success, making it easy to accept the delay of Tape 2. If these additional refinements serve to enhance the final product, then we can expect the bar of quality to be raised even higher.",
"An action adventure with unique visual and comfortable controls mixed with 3D and 2D. It is a game hard not to mention the resemblance with Nintendo's masterpiece 'Pikmin' series. Although the game has built an attractive gameplay using Tinykin, It is a bit of shame that there is no combat content that utilize it, lacking the entire tension.",
"Like the atomic structure of a cell, the game from Motion Twin is as complex as DNA, but everything is in one place for a reason. It effectively blends two genres together and becomes a completely new one, with mechanics adjusted to the millimeter, a graphic quality of scandal and a difficulty that invites one to die in order to learn.",
"Fallout 76: Wastelanders is a clear improvement on Fallout 76, with NPC's actually making West Virginia feel like it's worth exploring and doing things in for the first time since the game was released. The new quests are entertaining and engaging, featuring characters that are genuinely enjoyable to interact with and will put a smile on your face. Sadly, these are still too far apart and the core problems that held Fallout 76 back remain, particularly as a new character has to play the interminably dull and lifeless original content just to experience what was brought in with Wastelanders. It also doesn't help that this is riddled with bugs and the game has a number of issues with the mechanics that are only fixed by microtransactions and a subscription service.",
I imagine that only fans of the comic book will be willing to fork out that kind of dough for such a short visit with their pals that have been magically brought to life in the digital medium.,
"Real Boxing’s biggest sin is that it’s just too boring. In fact, it’s not even that real. The game isn’t actually simulationist at all. It’s far more arcade-y than anything else. It’s a lot like a fighting game, except each character has the exact same moveset with slight differences to their strength and HP. This combined with the lack of game modes and customization options, makes the game fall short of other Vita titles.",
"Forza Horizon 5 somehow raised an insurmountable bar to new heights. Playground Games continued to show off their prowess with game development and their striving to make a game that is fun for every type of player in every aspect of gameplay. Regardless of if you’re a racing fan or not, if you have Game Pass, Forza Horizon 5 needs to be the next game you play. You never know, it could be the jumping-off point into a new genre that you never knew you’d click with.",
"Apart from the visual step forward, the game feels like we're playing a slightly upgraded version of the Wii one, with a forgotten GamePad that should have been the reason to buy this one.",
Frenetic and bizarre fps of high rhythm focused on speedrun that will make you return again and again to its levels calculated to the millimeter. A highly enjoyable game with the seal of quality of Devolver Digital.,
"Dead Kings brings back the challenge rooms from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Revelations. That means a dark, dank underground setting full of platforming and puzzles. If puzzles aren't your thing, Arno's latest tale may not be for you. For everyone else, it's a solid, but unspectacular addition to Unity.",
"While some people may be looking for a similar experience to Super Meatboy, full of stressful levels that require some serious reflexes and problem solving, OVIVO offers the exact opposite. It’s a relaxing experience that doesn’t really challenge the mind or reflexes, instead it's more like weaving your way through a maze of fantastic artwork. Overall the game has nice simple mechanics and some lovely visuals and audio, however it falls short when it comes to difficulty, replayability, and price.",
"Even if you want to buy this because you're an MMA fan, I'll just warn you to try this game first before committing the hard drive space. If this is what Bellator's bringing to the small MMA sub-genre in the video game market, I don't think EA has anything to worry about when they start working on the next UFC game.",
"Endless Space 2 bolsters Amplitude’s reputation for superb, unique 4X faction design. The interwoven narrative and management mechanics produce a universe within which its easy to lose yourself, but some lingering bugs suggest the game may have launched prematurely.",
"First person perspective is not exactly the best choice for melee combat – it’s hard to keep your bearings when all you see is a mess of rat bodies. Still, this inconvenience is more than compensated by execution: there are few things more awe-inspiring than seeing your sword separate skaven’s head from body, while your pal sends a whole bunch of them tumbling down the stairs with his huge hammer. [Issue#203, p.88]",
Gameplay is a bit on the short side but it is still a great game to pick up and play while you are travelling or on holiday. It will really make you sit and think because the majority of the puzzles are not easy but you will feel a sense of accomplishment when you finally solve them.,
"For old, war-tested Stronghold players Crusader 2 is a triumphant evolution of the game that they've held dear for the last twelve years. For the rest of us though, there is perhaps no better time to see what all the fuss is about.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a vast improvement over its predecessor from a gameplay standpoint. Not so much in the story department. It's a very complex and deep tale, but it's also full of plot holes and nonsense, flaws that make it less meaningful than the old one. Despite this, The sequel to Final Fantasy XIII is a great J-rpg, with an amazing amount of content.",
"It is difficult to recommend Helboy Science of Evil to anyone. The common players will find serious difficulties in digesting such a non sense button smasher, whereas hardcore Hack and Slash users know that there are dozens of proposals superior in quality. The absence of argument and charisma in the characters will dislike even to the fans of Mignola´s work.",
"I can live with many of Need For Speed Unbound’s faults. Admittedly, there were fleeting moments when I enjoyed the routine of earning cash, upgrading, outrunning police, and climbing Lakeshore’s underground racing ranks. But, when a Need For Speed game spits in the face of people that use wheel and pedal setups, it’s tough to feel a need for anything other than a need to play a better game. There’s a foundation here to build upon, but EA and Criterion have their work cut out for them if they ever hope to compete with the giants of the racing game scene.",
"Ridge Racer Unbounded may not be true to the arcade series, but it is nonetheless a well done action racing game that surprises with a great online experience – and many explosions, of course.",
"Final Fantasy's final swan song for the PlayStation 2 is a complete masterpiece. Square Enix's attention to detail and love for their craft is embodied through and through. This is an adventure that will, without a doubt, stand the tests of time.",
"While GripShift does in fact offer varied, unique and entertaining gameplay, it feels like these genres never really gel together as well as they should. Still, it’s fun once you get used to the idea.",
"Welcome to Sonic Hell, where it feels like you're stuck in Rome and some gladiator prisoner that is being forced to compete mercilessly non-stop with other combatants. [Jan. 2007, p.91]",
"It does demand a fairly hefty system to run smoothly, especially if you want to pull the camera back and take in a broader view. Once you get a chance to take in that view, it’s undeniably satisfying.",
"In the end, the experience Firefall offers is one that’s almost there. It’s almost a fully engaging, entertaining shooter. It almost tells a fairly good story. Its systems almost feel worth the time, or money, you would put into seeing them through to their end. It’s almost there, but in the end, Firefall falls short.",
Metal Saga has ... a few one-liners. It possesses no traits to make it stand out among the current role-playing crop - or even the bulk of RPGs from a decade ago. Let this clunker rust.,
"Might & Magic Heroes VI follows the same concept as its predecessors, yet with more emphasis on the heroes this time around. Imbalanced and slow, but it is still easy to lose track of time while playing just a couple of more turns.",
"The best Batman game by far. Rocksteady has perfected the formula by offering a beautiful open world, more than twenty hours of main story and a broad number of diverse activities. This game really lets the franchise end with a bang.",
"It is an absolutely stunning game with a great story and an excellent presentation (as well as beautiful audio), but it didn’t quite reach the top of the mountain it set out to climb.",
"Throne and Liberty meets expectations by combining aspects from other games with its own special style. It's unique because we get to create a character with any class to play as we like. From level 1 to 30, the experience is excellent but the ""End Game"" stuff promise something good but we never know. On the other hand the learning curve can be overwhelming, but NCSoft has achieved something positive, and i hope that players will adapt to this game or we will stop hearing about it in 2 weeks.",
"As forgettable as the story mode is, this is a game that should be judged by the pleasure it can bring to a room full of gamers eager for furious arena combat and a splendid variety of team games. And judged by those criteria, it has few peers. [Apr 2005, p.94]",
"Simple but elegant mechanics combine with a wonderful soundtrack to create an incredibly immersive and joyful experience that no Vita-owner should miss. So plug in those earphones, crank the volume up to max and prepare for an almost transcendental voyage.",
"The Fallout 76 Wastelanders update might be the salvation of the game. The free expansion finally adds NPCs to the world and adds a lot of new content. Bethesda also improved the graphics, in particular the lighting system. It's still not technically perfect however and the new additions come with their own problems. Still, the Wastelanders update is a giant leap for Fallout 76.",
"Although the game is slightly disappointing on a couple of levels, the truth is its Mario Kart, who couldn't love it. The actual races are absolutely brilliant particularly in multiplayer, however the Battle Mode is surprisingly weak.",
"Ideally a strategy game such as Tropico 5 would give the player the choice of either a game or player directed playing experience. Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition at first blush gives the player more but once you start playing it, you realize it has also taken away something a segment of its fan base enjoyed before – freedom to play the game they want.",
"Ultimately, 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue has one purpose – to pave the way for Kingdom Hearts 3 – and it pulls it off incredibly well. Dream Drop Distance HD has a great story and some really cool mechanical ideas, but is let down somewhat by the limitations of the 3DS hardware it was adapted from. But 0.2 Birth by Sleep A Fragmentary Passage is just stellar. It gives the perfect taster of what to expect in Kingdom Hearts 3, while also being its own awesomely designed short-form experience. If we discount its smaller scale, 0.2 is probably one of the best instalments of the series we’ve ever had.",
"Criminal Girls quite ably eats up a good few hours early on, but simply fails to provide enough of a lasting experience to recommend. There are some interesting aspects, and it helps cater to a niche, but it's hard to find any area in the gameplay where things haven't been done considerably better elsewhere.",
"Apologising for broken content with more broken content feels like a bit of a slap in the face, and Dead Kings' confusing, far-from-user-friendly new mechanics make this DLC a bit of a disappointing prospect.",
"Resistance: Burning Skies is a competent game that simply falls flat in just about every category. The shooting is mechanically sound, but never really interesting. The presentation is simply broken at times, and the cut scenes are downright embarrassingly low-resolution. The online is dismissive and the campaign is short and flat. It really feels like this is more of an example of what can be done with a shooter on the Vita, than a thought-out experience.",
"If you're a fan who desperately wants to see the race from a first-person perspective this will scratch that itch, but there are many other titles such as the upcoming MotoGP 4 that explore the territory much further.",
"Side Order is an expansion than Splatoon 3 fans shouldn't overlook: the roguelite format drastically improves how to enjoy Splatoon's single player content. Well balanced, progression is satisfactory without being frustrating, although you'll have to adapt to the change. Lots of replay value, even if it feels a bit short.",
"I loved my time in the Aegean. The game has its flaws, and I gamed those flaws to find an easier way to victory. But I hope the team can patch the economic systems — or at least explain them — so that it makes more sense. I don’t think they can do anything about the sea battles except to say that this game didn’t have that big a budget. I would also have liked to have some staged battles that laid out the events of The Iliad or the sacking of Troy in a narrative path. But the game can provide fans of the series with many hours of fun. And that’s no small achievement.",
"Microsoft delivered a solid remake of a classic old title. Nostalgic for the old ones and a great history lesson for the newer, this is exactly what gamers need while waiting for Age of Empires IV. Legends never die...",
"NBA2K23 came with some interesting changes by bring back old memories. Jordan's legendary career and the year-based dynasty mode are both very attractive new features. NBA 2K23 is still the best basketball game in the world, even though it's still similar to NBA2K22. I'm glad to see that the NBA 2K series have made some innovations and changes, but there is still a lot of room for further improvements.",
"Unavoidable rendez-vous for the old-school games amateurs, the Xbox Live Arcade offers now a much justified remix of Guardian Heroes, odd mix between 2D brawler and RPG blessed by a iconic music score. Most developers would have failed, but Treasure prooves, 15 years later, that they stroke the right balance between a demanding technical approach and the pure visceral fun of beat'em all gameplay.",
"For the Warriors fans that are looking for hack ‘n slash with small RPG elements involved, I’d say go for standard Samurai Warriors 4. It is a much more condensed game that is a lot of fun to play. People looking for more strategy in their Musou games can find it here, but keep in mind, many of the strategy elements can come across pointless after a while.",
"If you love bullet hell shoot ‘em ups and have the patience to master your moves, there’s a lot of bang for your buck here, especially if you owned the original Sine Mora; anyone who bought the original version can upgrade to EX for free. The campaign is short, but there’s plenty of replay value in the various alternate modes for people looking to push themselves in pursuit of the leaderboard glory or just waste some time with a buddy.",
"Depth is the closest I've come to experiencing the kind of fear a game about killer sharks should generate since my younger days of playing Jaws on the NES. Future updates that clean up bugs and add new content could help it breach the surface and approach greatness. Until then, however, Depth floats listlessly in the ocean current.",
"I would buy the game just for the Mini-Golf alone. Like I said, every now and then a game comes along that renews my faith in companies making something fresh and also taking a risk.",
"Despite what Naughty Dog's crack programmers might think, you can't encode fun-ness into a videogame. Yes, there's lots of 'fun' to be had here, but is it really more fun than the original? Probably not. [Nov 2003, p.96]",
"A fair game that tries to do a little too much. The puzzle, platform and racing genres are all represented as advertised, but none of them are pulled off well enough to provide a particularly engaging experience.",
"Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3: Generation V makes for a sound handheld role playing game. Although some will find it hard to connect with the characters and universe, it’s hard to fault Generation V’s fluid combat and presentation features.",
"The best aspect of Lumines: Electronic Symphony is that you can play it for 10 minutes or an hour as you become mesmerised by the puzzle and music in front of you. It does help if you're into electronic music, especially with its thumping track listing. However if you're one of those people that become easily frustrated at puzzle games, you might want to look elsewhere for your enjoyment but this is definitely the Tetris of the 21st Century!",
"As someone that has greatly enjoyed the previous games in the series, Toy Soldiers: War Chest is a disappointing experience. The forced use of Uplay for much of the online content, DLC purchases being locked to the account that purchased it, and a myriad of technical issues hamper the quality of the game.",
"Exigo's multileveled gameplay is a good first step in an interesting direction, but unfortunately, that's not always enough to compete in the brutally competitive RTS genre. With more tweaking, Armies of Exigo could definitely give Blizzard a run for its money. [Dec 2004, p.126]",
"If 400 puzzles sounds like more Sudoku than you could ever want, much less need, I highly recommend Nintendo's own ""Brain Age"" as a superior alternative. It includes only 100 puzzles, but the interface is significantly better, and you get all the Brain Age stuff in addition to Sudoku, which is really just a side offering in that game.",
"If you stumbled over Dancing all Night because you like rhythm games, you might be in shock since it is very much story-driven. While the mechanics are solid you will be probably better off with Hatsune Miku’s last outing.",
Your ultimate goal is to slay your enemies with your katana in the most stylish way as possible. Just like in No More Heroes. Killer is Dead is actually surprising similar to No More Heroes. It is all about dodging and countering at the right time. [September p.78],
"Story gripes aside, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is just hands-down better than Final Fantasy XIII. It has more replay value, a more compelling battle system, an open world, an innovative exploration premise, and much more. If Final Fantasy XIII's laundry list of flaws turned you off to the Final Fantasy franchise, then Final Fantasy XIII-2 will get you back in.",
"It's obvious that SEGA doesn't pretend to innovate with this new OutRun, but its offering is quite good anyway. It's the perfect example of a classic arcade remade by today's standards and it has Magical Sound Shower in it, which is always a great addition.",
"It's obvious that the developers spent a long time adapting the single-player mode to compensate for the lack of the online mode. The four-player co-op mode is played via the ad-hock wireless system. Having players equipped with different weapons, both Blade and Gunner style, you will be able to hunt effectively as a team by ambushing the creatures, flanking them or forcing them down paths loaded with traps. [JPN Import]",
"Roll7 is to be applauded for putting together this unique shooter skater game. I really dug the 1970s vibe of the game both in the art direction and especially the score. This makes the game stand out aesthetically from other games. The only nit I have with the 2D art style, is that it makes judging jumps difficult due to the lack of depth perception. With a little practice, I was able to acclimate to it. Rollerdome is a blast to play, tailored to appeal to players of all skill types.",
"Lost Records: Bloom and Rage relatively successfully captures the essence of nostalgia and mystery in a completely original new adventure in the spirit of Life is Strange, but the gameplay is too simple and passive, even compared to previous Don't Nod releases.",
"As a showcase of the GameCube's technical abilities, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy doesn't measure up to other titles in the system's library. More importantly, as a game, it smacks of mediocrity.",
"The laziness of the enemies, repetitive combat and ridiculous slowdown are all against it; but the clever storytelling, great boss fights, high-quality presentation and rock-hard challenge ensure this is a step above a lazy, licensed game.",
"Epic, knowing the success of the first installment, has not taken any risk at all and gives us what they know we are going to like: an extraordinary pure action experience, outstanding in all technical and gameplay aspects and, above all, is hugely entertaining and guarantees hundreds of hours of adrenaline rush thanks to its campaign mode and online play through Xbox Live.",
"On paper, Fuel Overdose sounds like the perfect arcade blast to dip into for half an hour whenever you feel the urge. Unfortunately, the reality is a lot less impressive, leaving us with a game that is deeply flawed in several key areas.",
An entertaining balancing of a city budget and a flourishing metropolis resulting in a cheerful feeling is being destroyed by its need to build up several cities from the very beginning and by its not so user friendly road / whole city blocks construction.,
"If you're looking for a good fighting game this holiday that's accessible, not overly technical, and doesn't require a commitment or previous experience to enjoy, give Saint Seiya Brave Soldiers a serious look. It's hard to beat for the cost.",
"There are some mentionable problems with the game, like the sometimes-annoying camera system and overly simplistic gameplay mechanics, but overall this is an entertaining platformer that doesn&#146;t feel like it was rushed out the door in the hopes of making some quick cash.",
"A mix between Three Kingdoms and Thrones of Britannia, Troy is a solid game that has a lot to offer and guarantees many hours of addictive fun but might disappoint loyal Total War fans with some of the changes (e.g. diplomacy). If you’re new to the series, be prepared to power through the overwhelming beginning, fortunately with the help of one of the best tutorials I’ve ever seen. [11/2020, p.60]",
"The enemies are repetitive, the puzzles are simple, and players aren't given much freedom to explore, but what is here is fun to play -- thanks to an interesting story, excellent sound effects, and well-animated visuals.",
"True to the anime with it colourful casting of characters, Little Witch Acamedia : Chamber of Time is never convincing when it comes to its gameplay. Repetitive and poorly designed, the game is quickly boring and frustrating.",
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a decent movie-tie-in game, but that doesn’t make it the greatest game of all time. It’s certainly miles better than the other crap you can find on the market, but at the same time there are plenty of other better games you could also be playing.",
"Tropico 3 is a well-designed sim with just the right balance of complexity and micromanagement. It looks good, it sounds good and playing it just might teach you something. How many games can you say that about?",
"Rock Band 3 is a complete package and quite possibly the definitive music game. Once again, Harmonix defines and sets the bar for what the music genre can achieve. It will be hard pressed for anyone, Harmonix included, to top this game.",
"Forza Motorsport is like a dream for car lovers. Not only does everything play great, everything looks and even sounds great via the custom soundtracks feature. Seriously, what more could you ask for?",
"If there is a hint of helplessness it's in those marvellous moments when Soldiers' fabulous physics, rich environments and imaginative AI produce such totally unpredictable results, you can only look on in amused dismay. [PC Gamer UK]",
Calling has become a total failure. Fans of the Japanese horror genre will like this game but only if they wait for the price drop. The only gamers that will find this game creepy are the ones who aren't allowed to play it: children under the age of twelve.,
"I enjoyed my time with Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star as it satisfied my craving for a game in the Fate universe. The fighting controls are tight and responsive, and the action is intense. The lack of enemy variation was disappointing, but it didn’t take away from the frenetic fun of pulling off well animated combos against thousands of aggressors.",
"Succeeds where ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" and even ""Sim Theme Park"" failed&#8212;it gives you the true sensation of riding a rollercoaster, the logical tools to build them, and the ability to show your work quickly and easily.",
"High Hell is ample demonstration that good and simple game play still has a place in world of multi-gigabyte monsters with eight-figure (or higher) development and marketing budgets. It's perfect for those situations when you just want to sit down and shoot things for a few minutes without having to deal with even an iota of realism. After all, they're called ""games"" for a reason.",
"Kids and the parents who shop for them or nostalgic Atari 2600 gamers will find it a decent purchase, but it&#146;s recommended they rent it first as well to see if the unique control schemes aren&#146;t too frustrating.",
"Much like TV's Strictly Come Dancing, Just Dance 2014 adopts the same tried and tested formula that has seen it become one of this generation's premiere party games. It doesn't take any risks and fails to innovate, but thanks to its superb soundtrack, hilarious dance routines and much-needed online mode, it's worth dusting off those dancing shoes for one last jive.",
Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition may not be the prettiest game in the world on the Switch but the sheer amount of content and the overall enjoyment of it does make up for the visuals and even the performance.,
"With some dated design choices that hold it back from being the best that it could be, it may not be everyone's cup of tea. But, for those that have been waiting, this is like the ultimate form of comfort food, getting something that they love, to bring them back to a specific time and place that gives them their best memories.",
"Sexy Brutale is a title with an intriguing premise, backed up by a story well worth experiencing. However, the lackluster characterization and singular, uninteresting solutions to its puzzles hold it back from greatness.",
"I might have recommended this simplistic formula for younger gamers except for the fact that encounters with Omnidroid are some of the most tedious and unforgiving bouts I've ever fought. [Jan 2005, p.118]",
"This Final Fantasy VII project is a massive undertaking of an impossible scale. A single release stretched into three games? Preposterous. And yet, so far the team is totally nailing it. The first game was a smash hit, and Rebirth runs laps around it in almost every way. The performances, the plot, and the gameplay are all much improved. With a couple of notable exceptions. While I hated one or two sections with venomous passion, they aren't enough to spoil the experience. The game is less than perfect, but not by much. If you've been hotly anticipating this release, you were right to do so. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a fantastic follow-up to a pretty incredible game.",
"It's great to see a new ""contenter"" in a category of games occupied by giants. Omen of Sorrow is by no means a perfect game, but what it tries to do it does it right and it paves the way for AOne games to become a major player in the genre.",
"Boyfriend Dungeon is an excellent example of a flawed gem, with an original premise and an engaging gameplay loop marred by a lack of development of ideas and mechanics. Combat is really fun, until you realize it’s kind of shallow. The characters are interesting, until they become unbelievable or downright unlikeable. It's the kind of game that seems pretty great until you really get to know it, after which it can start to feel like work. We'd give Boyfriend Dungeon a very light recommendation, as there’s enough here to justify a purchase and you’ll likely be glad that you gave it a shot. That said, there are some legitimate issues in its execution, so maybe wait for a deep sale before picking it up.",
"A hurried game that attempts to borrow a previously successful formula and use it to boost franchise sales. Well, this reviewer says they’re going to have to try a lot harder than this to create fans.",
The arcade ports are proper versions of the included games and the addition of Pac-Man Vs. and the ability to get the full multiplayer experience over two Switches with just one copy of Namco Museum is nice.,
"New instruments, new ways of understading the musical scene of videogames industry. Rock Band 3's so far the best on its genre, with tons of new features, improved graphics and the possibility of learning how to play an instrument for real. It's expensive, but it's worth what it costs.",
"Saint Seya Brave Soldiers is definitely not a step further in comparison with Sanctuary Battle. Gameplay is still plain and not much varied, and game modes aren't attractive at all. A game just for enthusiasts.",
"Two years ago, Part Time UFO was launched on Android, and now, that game arrives to Nintendo Switch, with changes and new additions like coop, physical controls, new modes and all the graphics adapted to horizontal handheld mode. A joyful and fun proposal, for those looking at something lighthearted, replayable and ideal for short sessions.",
I wasn’t much a fan of episodic content before this game. I didn’t think they could include enough to warrant a $20 price tag but SiN Episodes: Emergence has gone a long way towards disproving that assumption.,
"The Last Story combines the best we can expect from modern gaming-luxuries with elements we know and love from the 16-bit-days and Japanese RPGs. This includes likeable characters, a well thought-out combat-system and a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat hour after hour.",
"Although it had some good ideas at the start, Those Who Remain feels like the most cookie cutter horror game possible that barely manages to present anything fresh enough to keep you interested across the six hour playtime.",
"Casual shooters would be better off waiting for the next attempt at this genre or even better, check out ""Coded Arms,"" another take on the FPS genre that offers a better, but somewhat repetitive solo game, and a much more engaging multiplayer component.",
"We'd have appreciated a thicker campaign, more visually diverse missions, and especially the option to play co-op over Xbox Live, but as-is, this hors d'oeuvre is still an entertaining treat.",
A fantastic update to the classic twin-stick shooter formula. I would be thrilled to see either a more substantial retail release using this format or an online-enabled downloadable sequel.,
"It’s not Metro 2033 anymore – Ukrainians look up to the western style of game development now and you have to get used to it. Last Light could have been better, but only a bit better. The atmosphere is amazing, there are moments when the game is poetically beautiful and in terms of sound it’s one of the best titles out there. [CD-Action 07/2013, p.50]",
"Despite the runtime being padded out by some meandering requests, A Space For The Unbound is a perfect little adventure title to curl up with on a rainy day. The myriad puzzles, while never overtly challenging, switch things up often enough to keep from growing tedious. At the same time, we wholeheartedly recommend it for its bittersweet, sombre narrative alone. It never veers too far into melancholic territory yet handles some heavy topics with grace. We didn’t come away gloomy from the potentially depressing themes depicted via the wonderful inhabitants of this beautifully rendered snapshot of Indonesia. Rather, we came away genuinely touched and inspired.",
"It might not be as deep as its PC counterpart, but it's perfect for console gamers, who are generally looking for a more casual experience. By the end, my buddy was living the high life, and I was actually proud that my Urb was finally one of the popular kids.",
"A totally cool game for racing games fans. With new ways of driving, in-race betting and enhanced challenges. Undoubtedly Need for Speed Unbound gave fans something they expected but sadly it's not perfect as it doesn't support all wheels which is a total waste.",
"While it’s not the new Kingdom Hearts game that many may have wanted, it’s much more than just a simple collection of old titles or some cheap cash-in. It’s a bridge to what awaits, and I can’t help but feel excited after watching the credits roll for the umpteenth time.",
"If you have already grown bored of the game, then Ultimate isn’t going to do much to reinvigorate your passion. If you haven’t, however, then Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate is a purchase that you pretty much have to make.",
Rounding out the package is a beautiful story where Klonoa must literally fight for the freedom to dream—a freedom that has been denied by a grouchy Emperor suffering from chronic insomnia.,
"The problems inherent to stealth games hold back Commandos Origins, but it's still a high-stakes, high-intensity RTS where even the smallest action can feel meaningful. Meticulous, difficult, and demanding, it will test your patience as much as your tactical insight, but when you finally get it right, Commandos Origins is rewarding.",
"Some minor balancing issues and a lack of ""strategic depth"" aside, Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a giddy blast from the past, spiffed up with a sweet new look, a beefed up multiplayer suite, and the return of some familiar faces reprising their roles from the dawn of RTS gaming.",
"Filthy Lucre is far from being perfect, but it still manages to be a fun game. If you can overlook its flaws, such as poor AI or odd design choices, you’ll find some enjoyment, particularly if you’re a fan of the stealth genre.",
"Personally, I had fun with Return to Arms, despite its flaws… until the end. I won’t spoil anything, but after 20 hours, one would expect more than the anticlimax at the end of the journey.",
"People who liked the first episode will be pleased to discover new game features, but also a new hero: DEATH. As regards the fans of RPG-based games, they'll find in Darksiders 2 an interesting Action-RPG title with great gameplay and a unique background despite some minor graphic imperfections.",
"Vast, beautiful, and every bit as epic as its subject matter, Troy's designation as a 'Saga' doesn't reflect a brief spin-off, but a soaring remix of the Iliad, with just the occasional annoyance or backwards step.",
"This is a great way to enjoy two quite obscure games, as unique as their creator, Goichi Suda. It was also a great chance to offer a translation to more languages that unfortunately was missed.",
"Diablo 2 Resurrected achieves what it set out to do: remaster Diablo 2. Its enhanced visuals and spectacular cinematics repackage the game in a whole new way, making it feel as though it really is your first playthrough all over again. Breaking this immersion, though, are a slew of irritating bugs that are likely to be fixed soon. As patches drop over time we hope this sorts itself out, but at the moment they can be so game-breaking that they make you want to do diabolical things to your computer. Despite all of this, I’m excited to jump back into the game. In fact, I’m itching to do it. Why? Because evil has returned, and it’s the Diablo 2 I know and love.",
"An intense gameplay from fast phased souls-like combat, as well as visuals and scores that complete the dark fantasy worldview, are definitely a satisfactory. However, some of the elements such as insufficient accessibility functions and unclear map composition are still preventing players to immerse themselves.",
"The visuals aren't great and Gat out of Hell isn't exactly innovating, but Saints Row remains a highly enjoyable experience, due to its ideal combination of humour, action and open world activities. If you haven't played this before, it is definitely recommended.",
"Thanks to its vibrant art, music, and storytelling, I had a wonderful time with South of Midnight. Its narrative goes to some surprisingly dark places, yet it still brims with whimsy, making it a fitting adaptation of the source mythology's similar tone. I couldn't have told you what a Rougarou was a few weeks ago, but thanks to this game, I've got a catchy melody of its name that plays on repeat in my head. It's fitting that, like the stories and songs it seeks to honor, South of Midnight has successfully passed Southern folklore on to a new, wider audience.",
Spider-man: Shattered Dimensions is an enjoyable action game. The gameplay is solid and splitting the adventure in four different realities works pretty well. Unfortunately there are some bugs and the virtual camera has some issues.,
"The graphics are gorgeous and the game engine has some excellent physics. With the excellent sound effects and music, the game drew me right into the atmosphere, and these days, all gamers should be demanding no less.",
"So here's the deal: If you like sims and have the patience to let things run on their own for stretches of time, you'll probably enjoy Tropico. If you're a Tropico fan from the old days, expect more of the same except with prettier graphics and make your decision based on that. If you're the type of sim player that enjoys building large SimCity style metropolises, Tropico probably isn't for you as you won't be building any San Juans in the game. Lastly, for everyone else, the slow pace of the game and the time it takes to get a working economy will probably try your patience too much.",
"Sitting, uneasily as it does, between pure bred sim and arcade flyer, it should serve well as an introduction to the genre for those who've yet to reel through their first barrel roll, while the more hardcore player should find some challenge with the difficulty level ramped up.",
Forza Horizon 5 is the best open world driving game ever and one of the best in the speed genre globally. Playground Games has once again surpassed itself with a varied ‘crossover’ in which each kilometer traveled is worth its weight in fun and spectacularity.,
"If you have a solid internet connection and have the time to dedicate to the game’s impressive franchise mode, Madden NFL 10 is a must-buy. But if you’re a more casual gamer just wanting to play this game for a bit, you might be better pressed to get last year’s version of the game.",
"The procedure for awarding continues is definitely far too liberal and though the combo system has been greatly improved, the controls still need to be simplified to make them more practical.",
"It’s equal parts frustration and exhilaration, awesome when you’re winning, aggravating when a moment’s lapse leads to ignominious defeat. Yet the forward-thinking mission design and the pace and balance of the gameplay means it’s still weirdly addictive and absorbing. It’s no longer the best of its kind, but this is one historical artefact that’s still worth playing here and now.",
"Listen: Insane works. It works because it's multiplayer, it works because it's simple, and it works because it's fun. You'd do well to remember that, but you won't, because you're so desperate to replay the cliched gaming you've already experienced on your thousand-pound calculator. Stupid. All the best...",
"Hellbound has potential, and will surely find an audience for both its nostalgia and its challenge. While the story is almost completely unnecessary, it's a real shock that the whole narrative focus appears to not be concluded in the game, though. Just as the story gets going, and the first big boss is defeated, the endgame credits roll, leaving Hellbound feeling unfinished. That feeling is compounded by the fact that the main reason for returning comes from the score-based survival mode which is still available as a free download on Steam. Hellbound is not big, nor is it clever, and in all the wrong ways.",
"Sonic Team's most recent Wii offering is evidence that it's attempting to claw its way out of a deep grave crammed with disappointing titles. Some diehard Sonic fans with unlimited patience may find enjoyment here, but the rest of us should pick up one of Sonic's fully 2D titles until they get it right.",
"The whole thing is wrapped up in a darling Fisher Price aesthetic and presented with wit and style. A lack of offline multiplayer and Microsoft's dodgy dictionary compromises the package, but it's got more modes than you deserve and a ridiculous 400 point price tag.",
"The visual style is very unique and captivating, the quiet storytelling with the focus on experiencing the world based on perception and expectation is a breath of fresh air. But it all feels very safe. In the end you are not Rae’s guardian or protector but rather a companion on her travels.",
"Although RotWK certainly doesn’t justify rushing out and purchasing the original if you don’t already have it, BfME2 fans who can put up with the micromanagement and fancy some new challenges will find plenty to love here.",
"Where The First Berserker: Khazan stumbles in its crashes, surface-level narrative and overabundance of loot management, it more than makes up for with sensationally satisfying combat, wonderfully moody atmosphere, exceptional dark fantasy visuals and a gauntlet of brutal yet empowering bosses to overcome. Khazan may not be the most powerful of all Souls-like protagonists, but through sheer perseverance and rage, he's not far off joining the highest echelons.",
"This is a huge, well-made title that stays true to the roots of the series without throwing in the towel and becoming a straight-up nostalgia trip. It can be punishing at times, and its elaborate plot is a spectacular misfire thanks to the horrendous voice acting, but it's a must-play for Might & Magic fans.",
"Behind the appearance of an idle game with a weird palette lies a deeply strategic title, which requires a careful management of resources and the ability to foresee the moves of our hero in advance. Its simplicity makes it a game for everyone, while its complexity will make it a real challenge for veteran adventurers and RPG players. The camp management, the gathering of materials, the weapons and enemies statistics, the unlockable classes and the combinations of memory cards make Loop Hero one of the best strategy games of recent times.",
"With its fast pace and emphasis on explosive action, Jupiter Hell is a more-than-welcome addition to the ranks of the roguelike genre. Even without the nods to its better-known brethren, it still packs quite a wallop. It isn’t perfect, but I loved blasting demons and zombified minions too much to care. Now, where is that chainsaw?",
"I loved Dungeon Defenders Awakened. Chromatic Games have got the core gameplay down pat. Maps are short and sweet, and there are extra modes for when I feel like I am ready to play for longer or try a different strategy.",
"They really don't make games like Hell Yeah anymore. It's one of the most random and oddball games I've played. It's one of those games where a bunch of wildly creative developers got together, had a bunch of fun, and made a game without ever asking ""why?""",
"The missions, characters, expansive city environment, sound and graphics all pull together to create an enjoyable experience. The game is, however, filled with minor flaws, and the camera causes frustration. With a weak story and minor technical faults Grand Theft Auto Advance was never going to be more than just a fun game.",
"The bland story mode, despite whisking you away to numerous locations, features lame brain artificial intelligence, a boring narrative, corny characters and the same point A to point B objectives, making it worth just a few hours of play.",
"A SoulsBorne game with its own twist which turns out to be pretty entertaining, especially when it all comes together. And that is also our main concern; there are plenty of times when things don't come together at all which results in frustrating gameplay. Too bad, because the core of Immortal: Unchained is good.",
"With interesting setting and characters, Close to the Sun starts as a piece of art, but it doesn't keep its premises due to hurried pacing and a bit superficial evolution of the story. Non trivial jumpscares and a good direction make this short game really a missed opportunity and only a decent horror adventure.",
"The Roottrees Are Dead is a triumph of investigative fiction, offering a compelling yet grounded family mystery within countless articles, websites, and archives waiting for you to uncover. The game has been much improved over its original iteration on itch.io, and the extra content “Roottreemania” adds a cool follow-up mystery to the main one. Any fan of investigation games will have a great time with The Roottrees are Dead.",
"FC25 is, once again, more of an update rather than a full-fledged sequel. Nevertheless, there's a reason it remains the king of the sport, thanks to some welcome quality-of-life improvements in Ultimate Team and the well-executed addition of Rush Mode.",
"The Great Escape is saved by a few good set-pieces and the licence, but it's hard not to feel hard done by. Those willing to endure yet another stealth game could find their morale ebbing away by the end of this. [Edge]",
"Armored Core 4 is more accessible than its predecessors; and at its core, beneath the complicated controls and imposing arsenal of body parts, it's a pretty simple, superfast, graceful and smart mech-combat game, and it deserves your attention. [JPN Import]",
"While quite different from the previous single-player GWENT experience, GWENT: Rogue Mage is an extremely solid title that masterfully combines mechanics from the card game introduced in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with roguelike mechanics. With tons of different cards and different strategies, Alzur's search for the mutagens that will create The Witcher is an extremely engaging one, despite the smaller focus on story, compared to other games belonging to the popular series.",
My time playing Lumines has been the only time in the last week during which I wasn't panicking. I come out of a 45-minute session feeling rested and kind of euphoric. How's that for an endorsement?,
"True, the content available on Xbox Live continues to improve, but even with the spate of excellent titles to hit the service over the last year or two, there are very few as good as Hell Yeah! Wrath Of The Dead Rabbit.",
The outstanding Necromancer class and an excellent helping of side missions in a beautiful world make The Elder Scrolls Online: Elsweyr a great expansion even though its main storyline disappoints.,
"Possibly the single best action game ever, but certainly in the history of the Xbox 360 is all you need to know about this must buy game. The co-operative gameplay, multiplayer and The Horde mode are also great additions for the gamer who likes to play with friends.",
"By the end of the game, I felt invested in the characters to the point that I couldn’t help but get emotional when a catharsis occurs. Röki features a perfect feel-good story, with lighthearted characters that are easy to identify with and invest in. The world is so well-thought-out, and the way that the game guides the player throughout the story is an extremely welcome escape from the uncertainty of the real-world in our current pandemic times. I fully recommend getting lost in this beautiful world with Tove.",
"A sturdy conversion of a robust set of board game rules. The top-down, corridor-heavy setting is reminiscent of Space Hulk, but Legions of Steel places more emphasis on equal fire-fights between the competing factions.",
"The control method and lazy design of the later levels threaten to dampen the early enjoyment, but Crush must be praised for trying to innovate, and is thus a worthy purchase for any PSP owner in search of their next puzzle fix.",
"It's the rare adult who will possess the constitution and fleetness of foot to stand in for more than a few perhaps enjoyable but confused, confounding minutes; for most of us, DDR, especially in a Disney TV-branded version, will not rise in our esteem much above spectator sport.",
"At 10 to 12 hours, Röki is a substantial adventure that avoids some of the typical pitfalls of the genre. While there is a fair bit of backtracking, puzzles feel naturally entwined with the story as it unfolds, with significant new elements that change things up just when it’s needed. Meanwhile, the nature of where this story goes effectively draws you closer to this family’s struggles, taking it beyond a simple fable. It’s a small game with a lot of heart.",
"A surprisingly solid puzzle title for the Nintendo DS. It's addictive and fun, and easy enough for anybody to get into and have fun. The difficulty ramps up, but that's a good thing.",
"Simply an addictive and adorable game that does a wonderful job evoking the same sense of wonder many of us first experienced on our childhood trips to Oz, Narnia, or Middle Earth.",
"If you were expecting Sword of Mana to be the classic RPG that ""FF Adventure"" was, though, you may want to lower your expectations slightly. If you don't, you may be surprised -- in both good and bad ways.",
"When it comes to sitting shoulder to shoulder with some of your friends, Fuzion Frenzy 2 is a passable alternative to having to teach a new player how all the buttons work in another game such as Gears of war. But since it doesn't have much long-term appeal.",
"I came into Lushfoil Photography Sim expecting to love it, and maybe that was a mistake. I do like it. I plan on returning to it for little escapes sometimes (emphasis on little). There is just something I love about taking a view that countless others have seen and putting your own twist on it; as it turns out, that feeling can also exist thanks to video games. Unfortunately, the camera controls never became intuitive, and accessibility around motion sickness is lacking. Lushfoil Photography Sim has a solid base, but I could never recommend it to someone without also pointing out the heavy negatives.",
"People don't live in movie studios. They live in houses and flats that are lit for comfort, not to fulfill the technical requirements of an aging webcam. If you really want to put yourself and your friends on the TV, leave this failed experiment on the shelf, and put the money towards a digital camcorder instead.",
"VC issues aside, which aren’t anything new, NBA 2K23 is undoubtedly the best entry in the series for some years. Jordan Challenge is a great addition that can eat up many hours of your time, while MyCareer is more engrossing than ever thanks to its entertaining story. But ultimately, it’s the gameplay changes that make NBA 2K23 worth picking up. Playing basketball from the comfort of your couch has never looked or felt so good.",
"Loop Hero is a unique and different proposal that brings a fresh approach, with character and capable of engaging anyone who approaches it with an open mind. One of those titles that must be approached with restraint if you don't want to end up compromising the rest of your responsibilities.",
"For the low price of $10 though I can look past the issues with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and play it even as is just for the pure bloody fun it was. If you want to relive your childhood then this is one of the arcade packs I suggest you buy before any other because let's face, everyone wanted to be Liu kang or Sub-Zero at one point or another, and this is as close as you're going to get. Not counting the brand new versions with HD graphics and killer X-Ray moves.",
"The change of engine in Monster Energy Supercross 25 - The Official Video Game will bring, in the medium and long term, the necessary benefits to a franchise that was clearly stagnating. But the current version of the game still relies on its old qualities in gameplay, while suffering from the same limitations in both the visual presentation and the conservatism of the game modes.",
"For the creators out there, RPG Maker Fes is a great little package with plenty of basic development tools to play with – a “My First RPG Maker”, if you will. For those who just want to play some quality RPG games, step away and play almost any other standalone RPG on the 3DS.",
"Just Dance 2014 has a lot going for it. The tracklist is solid and offers a varied selection of musical stylings (though it never strays too far from dancey, which is to be expected), and the choreography is accessible, but still provides something of a challenge for anyone looking to really nail a routine down to its details.",
"Ronin is a refreshing platformer in where you utilize both the tactics and your quick hands. Unusual mix of a tensile action with platformer has a bit clumsy controls and some of its game rules are -at least- strange, yet you spend a great time with Ronin.",
"Bound in Blood is not only an improvement but also a fun shooter with a lot to offer. Although the game does suffer from a few problems, what really stand out are the great story, bullet-fueled action and excellent multiplayer mode.",
"The ports are nearly arcade-perfect for the most part, though a few of the games suffer from control issues. Still, at a retail price of less than $20, AAE can be worthwhile if you're feeling nostalgic.",
"Being rather positive of the game, it manages to stick the landing thereabouts with the narrative told and its escape room like puzzles. Even with the complaints of spoon force feeding, it gives the player enough leeway to think about world. With the abstract take working well, just not as fully realised as some might expect.",
"Ultimately, Atari Flashback Classics is a fine collection. The sheer quantity of entertainment software is reason enough to warrant a look. Alongside certified arcade greats, is a wealth of middling-to-fun Atari 2600 and 5200 titles. Even those that weren't around back then will probably be able to find something that they can really connect with, with one example being the previously-unreleased Aquaventure. Of course, considering the era in which these were made, it might be extremely difficult to garner any appreciation for what's here. Still, it is a valuable time capsule for those who weren't around for gaming's infancy.",
"Knowledge is Power makes good use of PlayLink to open the door to those more familiar with tapping on phones and browsing the internet than knowing where that Square button is meant to be, and that’s its real strength. Outside of that, it has a few other ideas, but ends up as a fairly middle of the road quiz game that’s easy enough to put on the telly and your phones for a quick test of knowledge.",
"As a fighter, Castlevania Judgment employs too many design ideas that are neither well planned nor well executed. It's a strange misstep for the beloved series, one that Konami hopefully learns from.",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue is a collection which fans of the saga should not miss. Despite not overflowing with contents, this anthological prologue to the story of Kingdom Hearts is the missing piece of the series created by Nomura.",
"Quarrel is an interesting mix between Risk and Scrabble where you must conquer the enemy territory using anagrams. It's a nice game that can keep you playing for a long time, if you tolerate its frustrating AI that sometimes gives the sensation of cheating.",
"Brave Soldiers is the example of how not to make a game. It’s too simple, the differences between the characters aren’t noticeable and the story is too complicated to understand. Even though it offers us a lot of content, it doesn’t impress us in any way.",
Gears of War 2 helps to change the perception of the 'angry space marine' shooter by thanks to a compelling story at its core. There are points in Gears of War 2's ridiculous and explosive Brumack set-pieces that you'll wonder how you'll ever be able to go back to the original game without being under-whelmed.,
"Ultimately, the success of Dungeon Defenders: Awakened can’t be fully determined at this point in time, and there’s a feeling that the console releases may be where the game gets an opportunity to shine, away from the ready comparisons to its predecessors. It’s certainly highly enjoyable and there’s an excellent base for it to build upon, but it remains to be seen how well it manages to build upon its current content and keep players coming back for more.",
"Mario and Sonic 2014 certainly has its issues, but it’s definitely a step above previous titles in terms of event design and overall enjoyment. It’s a more complex and engaging than the usual minigame menagerie, and the distinct franchise twists in the Dream Events are a welcome bit of fanservice. It’s not a gold medal winner just yet, but Mario and Sonic 2014 is a stronger contender than it’s ever been before.",
"When making a video game of any kind, it's important for the developer to keep in mind gameplay. Rebirth lacks this rather core element, which makes it hard to recommend despite solid graphics, great sound, and a much improved battle mode.",
"MMOs are difficult to grade on their own, but Throne and Liberty is a pretty great entry into the genre. NC Soft makes getting to max level easy enough, but the endgame grind for gear may turn some players off. Overall, there's a lot to enjoy here with a beautiful world to explore, plenty of PvE and PvP events to partake, and so many players to interact with. For a free to play MMO, it clears the bar quite easily for games worth giving a shot.",
"Diablo II: Resurrected is far from perfect. The changes in character design are likely to rile up returning players, and the archaic gameplay probably won’t agree with younger generations weaned on more streamlined, sophisticated experiences. While I appreciate that this legendary title is now available in an improved format, it’s not a caveat-free recommend.",
"While the problems that exist in Alida are unfortunate, the game is still recommendable to die-hard first-person adventure devotees, especially those who don&#146;t mind rolling up their sleeves and getting down and dirty with puzzles.",
"While not without some criticism, Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time is an enjoyable experience. The time spent running to random points of the academy in order to advance the story could have benefited by being more streamlined to feel less monotonous and the map system could use some tweaking, but the game is entertaining past those shortcomings.",
"The game's strong points remain the atmosphere and the script, but if you're not willing to compromise when it comes to graphics and game length, you won't be able to enjoy the two things the producers got right.",
"A great way to dive into the folklore of the Russian North. The setting is remarkably fresh, the story is well-written, and while the card battles are rather mediocre, the game doesn’t penalize the player for skipping them. [Issue#255, p.50]",
I found Crush to be an innovative twist on the platform/puzzle genre. The game is suitable for all ages and includes a hint feature which you can enable or disable in the options menu. My only complaint with the game is that it feels a bit short with only 40 levels.,
"There are a lot of difficult levels, a lot of difficult enemies. It’s awesome. I appreciate a good challenge in today’s games, and JAK II offers it. It’s plenty long too, and will keep you playing for a good time.",
"In Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, there is no princess to save. In this game you will play as one of your favorite heroes in a couple of reasoning mini games. This game is easy to handle with a lot of content. It is big but it is for short term session only because of the repetitive side of the game. Which justifies the price of 10€ on the eShop of Nintendo.",
"While Burning Skies in fact proves that the Vita is capable of handling the First Person Shooter genre, the game in itself leaves much to be desired. A weak story, an uninteresting online multiplayer and an overall lack of polish keep it from reaching the lofty heights the franchise deserves.",
"One of the greatest ever made. From the non-stop action, enormous sprites, dazzling visuals, and colorful characters, Sega and Treasure really hit this one out of the stratosphere.",
"Although Neon White goes by in a blur, that fast pace is only made greater with excellent level design, fun characterisation, and so many little secrets to find. Though I was expecting to be entertained by Neon White's gameplay for a few hours, its likeable cast and surprisingly sincere geekiness has managed to stay in my mind long after the credits have rolled. It's hard to really grasp its long-term staying power but Neon White has secured its place on many lists for the end of the year.",
"EA Sports FC 25 establishes itself as a new evolution in the series. There's nothing revolutionary within the game, but it does add enough incentive to be engaging, despite being ‘same old, same old’. FC IQ has impact, Rush mode is fun and the presentation remains impeccable.",
"Forge is a fun break from the monotony of the same old competitive multiplayer games, but with only four maps, two game types, and an uninspiring progression system, it currently lacks the depth to be something you can fully sink your teeth into.",
"The team at Saibot Studios have made exactly what they promised to their Kickstarter backers, but I was left wanting more. This doesn't make Hellbound a bad game, but it certainly feels like there were a few things left on the cutting room floor as I finished the game. After a somewhat slow start in the campaign, I was happy to finish the fight, and any fan of 1990s FPS fans could do worse than slaying demons in Hellbound.",
"After Us is a stylish looking game with a very gloomy, but also realistic view of the future that awaits our consumer society. The level design is creative, the platforming is challenging using both horizontal and vertical route options, and the matching synth music enhances the surreal atmosphere. Yet After Us also drops a lot of stitches in the field of gameplay progression, character development and the story, so you don't miss much if you ignore this reality check.",
"Despite an inevitably cramped interface, RPG Maker Fes is still a solid, yet demanding game creation software, all the more so without a proper - if not fun - tutorial. But neither portability nor simple online sharing system can make up for such restrictions concerning tools and content. These tend to limit, or even format the end results. Considering the time they require and the DLC policy, it would be wiser to invest in the massively more elaborate PC version.",
"Whilst an admirable attempt at offering a fresh take on what is already becoming a fairly staid genre, Toadman Interactive has unfortunately missed the mark when it comes to one of the most crucial elements of making these games work.",
"If you like killing enemies with a katana like Kill Bill, this indie-action-platformer could be your game. The design is quite near to the also platform-title Gunpoint and it combines it with stealth- and assassination-elements like in Mark of the Ninja. The combat is quite difficult, sometimes frustrating, especially because of its try-and-error passages, that can freak you out. The Soundtrack is great and the cartoon-graphics-style fits well to the setting. UI is simple to learn and timing your actions is the key for success in the game.",
"On the one hand, it's a flat, uninspired single-player campaign, with vehicles and base-level NPC co-op play holding it up with shoes strings. While on the other hand, the multiplayer game is substantial, creative, and wildly fun.",
"Castlevania Judgment is a lot better than it should be given its brief time in development and small budget, but still not half as good as it could have been. Thanks to the injection of some good ideas and heaping piles of love for the series, Judgment does justice to the Castlevania name, though just barely.",
"I love ACE Team, and I love what the team suggests about the future of South American game development as it continues to grow. Quirky and creative, and so very funny, Rock of Ages 2 is unlike many “comedy” games in that it backs the humour up with quality gameplay, very worthy of respect.",
"Rollerdrome is a wonderfully chaotic and satisfying game. The gameplay steals the show, the drawn style is unique and the DualSense really adds something. However, the full potential of the concept is not fully exploited. Especially the lack of variety keeps Rollerdrome from being a real masterpiece.",
"This is the surprise action game of the year, not that the arrival is any surprise; D3 has been hyping this title for nearly two years, but the sheer quality and originality of gameplay, mostly thanks to a single little throwing weapon, makes this a must-play title for any action gamer.",
"If you are not expecting an ""Alan Wake 2"" then with American Nightmare you will have 4-5 hours of great gameplay and unique storytelling of a quality that you will not find in many recent games.",
"The steering lacks precision, and the quality of the level design is a bit wobbly at times. But Sonic Colours still surprises with its quality, and it seems that Sega and Team Sonic have finally understood what makes a good, modern Sonic game. One of the strongest Sonic games in ages.",
"Even with its shortcomings Vivid Games has done an admirable job of bringing a somewhat fairly authentic feel to a boxing game for the PS Vita. Sure, it has a few issues but it has enough going for it that most gamers and fans of the sport will like it.",
"Ridge Racer Unbounbed departs from the series' classical style, offering us a grittier, urban and destructive world, with very satisfying gameplay and good variety even without introducing great innovations to the genre. If you love arcade racing games and maybe you look back with nostalgia at series like PGR, you won't be disappointed. A good new starting point that deserves to be expanded further.",
"Trust us. Cheaper, deeper stuff than this can be bought on Xbox Live Arcade. Unless you're truly desperate for an old-school party game experience, or you plan to be so drunk that anything will amuse you, we suggest you save your money for something else.",
"That lackluster combat is a lot to get past in order to enjoy the tiny morsels of classic Hellboy wit, and the lingering bugs that cause Hellboy to snag and hang on bits of the environment don't help either.",
"The initially gripping chases lose their effect quickly. When I hear the very well-written dialogues in comparison, I would rather spend much more time with Ada, Tesla and Co. and learn more about them.",
"The look and feel of Naruto is spot on and coupled with gaming moments such as being able to leap from branch to branch with timed button presses and looking sexy as hell in the process, then moments like in the heat of battle pulling off an amazing jutsu, make this game what it is.",
"While the game will not appeal to fans of more serious, focused shooters, and the Story is still not quite up to scratch, this game is still highly recommended thanks to some excellent humour and the top-class multiplayer.",
"Dead or School often intrigues in appearance, but never quite capitalises on the unique blend of the mundane. Technical issues bog down the core experience, and the lack of restriction or respect for the rest of the content sours what could have been a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the underground.",
Trek to Yomi is a good game. He wisely mixes action combat and exploration. Too bad for some ingenuity that often makes it not very user friendly and which all seem to derive more from inexperience than from lack of time. If you are a lover of Japanese folklore and culture you will still have something to eat.,
"The Side Order DLC adds an interesting new mode to Splatoon 3. The Tower of Order is surprisingly challenging and the gameplay is diverse with color chips to change your playstyle. However, we would have liked to see some more variation in challenges and boss fights, which makes the randomized floors feel the same a bit too quickly. For the price however, Side Order is a must-have DLC for fans of Splatoon 3.",
"From my perspective, this title fails to find its audience – it doesn’t deliver enough content for the older kids, and the frustration factor is too high for younger kids. I’d say you could catch this one when Toys R’ Us runs their next 2-for-1 sale, but I’d be hard pressed to recommend it at full retail price.",
"Diablo 2 is back in a Resurrected version and could appeal to purists as well as young people eager for challenges: The plastic has been completely revised, everything has been modeled again, and is now very flattering for the retina. The atmosphere of the game is as crazy as ever even though the storytelling has gotten a little old. The same can be said with the gameplay, which has hardly changed an iota: it's still just as nervous, addicting, devilishly catchy, but at the cost of sometimes outdated ergonomics. Nevertheless, we do not shy away from our pleasure of replaying this legend in conditions much more in line with what is being done in 2021.",
"Taking a year off truly helped the core experience of Monster Energy Supercross 25, but at the sacrifice of cut content. The change to the Unreal Engine 5 provides a different experience than in the past. The updated riding physics makes the game both more accessible and more difficult. Tight cornering and fighting for grip is the biggest hurdle. The Neural AI in the fantastic Career Mode is great, something that other racing series could use. The removal of the Compound hurts, but the Rhythm Section mode helps to make up for that loss. Mainly, fans of the series looking for a current Supercross experience finally get it in 2025, as the game is finally set in the year it releases.",
"The excellent fusion of music and traditional block falling play continues to impress, reinvigorating the series and leaving the door wide open for even cooler sequels down the line. Pick this up immediately, and grab a pair of headphones while you're at it.",
"It's pole position once again for Codemasters' F1, despite a lack of any real, meaningful changes over F1 2012 beyond the addition of F1 Classics. F1 2013 is still a superb racer, but we're expecting big things for next year.",
"With its engaging story steeped in Scandinavian folklore, varied and satisfying puzzles, unique art direction, and terrific audio, Roki is a real treat for every fan of the frosty North. [10/2020, p.87]",
"Hard West 2 is a very solid and challenging turn-based strategy game, characterized by a beautiful story and some interesting adventure elements. That said, the difficulty level can be too hard, forcing you to proceed through a thousand trials and errors.",
"If you’re expecting completely remade games, this isn’t the remaster collection for you. But if you want to relive your childhood memories and frustrations with Klonoa, the Phantasy Reverie Series is the way to do it. Getting two cult-classics in one is a fantastic deal, and if you can look past the quirks and situate yourself firmly in 2001, you’ll find these games just as perfect as you remember them. And if you missed out on the Klonoa hype as a kid but enjoy early 2000s platformers and want to see what all the fuss is about, there’s no better time to dive into the dream than now.",
"It does not matter if you played The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask ten times or never, as a 3DS user you have to have this game. Design and graphics are updated, which makes this remake even more worth while.",
"The story is surprisingly quick to blaze through as well, but there’s a lot to come across that the game doesn’t really seem to force on you, and Pikuniku’s world and gameplay is just memorable enough that this is a fun little title you may get more mileage out of than you’d expect.",
"Xtreme Legends is – quite simply – the game that Dynasty Warriors 5 should have been. Some real improvements have been made, and the game is much deeper than it ever has been before.",
"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a fantastic combination of absurd Japanese humor and point and click mechanics. It's filled to the brim with charm, good laughs and brilliant puzzles that will keep you locked to the screen for hours on end.",
"A disappointment. You can see the brilliance of its world, characters and heart shining through like a star. You can even see the skeleton of a genuinely deep RPG title. But the game fights your efforts to enjoy yourself at every opportunity, be it via bad design choices, repetitious gameplay or infuriating technical problems.",
"Knytt Underground isn’t a game for everyone. It is rich and fascinating in its own way, but the convoluted plot and the simple mechanics will surely discourage those players looking for a more canonical experience.",
"A great package that any squad gaming fan will take to immediately - it's not everything we hoped it would be, admittedly, but don't let that put you off what is still a worthy offering.",
"It’s certainly not as amazing as it once was sixteen years ago. But, it will scratch that itch if you feel nostalgic or if you have 800 Microsoft Points in your account begging to be spent.",
"Unfortunately, this ‘puzzle’ system doesn’t have as much depth as you’d want – especially during later levels, with things finishing before they’ve really gotten started. There’s a good idea here, presented in a way that is silly enough to be charming, but not dim-witted.",
"In truth Wolverine could have scored higher simply due to more time being allowed for bug testing, and possibly having no association with the terrible film. But that doesn’t prevent it from being a good solid, and ultimately, fun game.",
"Metro Last Light is an excellent first person shooter that we recommend to all FPS maniacs. Those who were fascinated by the original Metro 2033, can proceed to an instant buy without even checking the package with a Geiger counter.",
"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron may just be the game you need to end your summer with a big, loud bang. Fans of big thrills will be impressed by the cinematic, action-packed campaign, Transformers fans will be happy to follow the engaging storyline, and multiplayer gamers can find a lot to enjoy in this latest installment. If you're looking for a great roller coaster ride of a game, FOC will provide just that.",
"Few stories in games can successfully make me hate the “protagonist” and at the same time draw me compulsively further into the events and plot twists. Paired up with the simplistic and impressionistic art of the story frames, the atmosphere and the complexity of the intertwining yet opposing factions bandying for influence over hopelessly corrupt Jack Boyd and you have a Noir story set in the 80’s that could rival the classics.",
"Both look and sound are truly excellent. Be it the design of the various locations of the game, the performances of the actors bringing it to life or the absolutely fantastic soundtrack. If you allow yourself to get immersed in the world of “South of Midnight” you will find an experience that feels oddly authentic despite the setting being fairly magical. The weakest points are when “South of Midnight” starts to feel too much like a videogame by placing upgrade points on a path during very emotional scenes or being structurally way too obvious. Nevertheless the experience is one of a kind and can be extremely engaging.",
"Killer is Dead is a decent action game, but seeing as the genre is brimming with other titles that offer a much more complete experience, there’s little reason to spend your time here rather than elsewhere.",
"Rollerdrome is Roll7 stepping out of their comfort zone and creating something original while trying to retain the magic fans of their games know and love. At the same time, I can't help but to feel that this is more like a concept for something much more complete that is yet to come.",
"Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit sits somewhere between a hardcore classic and a shameless parody, and luckily, I happen to be a fan of both. It's not perfect, but like Vincent Vega once said, ""personality goes a long way.""",
"The Thaumaturge is presented as an RPG, but you should not expect great possibilities for character interpretation or a plot that at any moment can be heavily influenced by our choices. If this is not a problem, however, what remains is an excellent game with an interesting plot, which transports us to one of the best cities seen in a video game.",
"The extra content is neat, but given that most of it is only visual it’s difficult to justify the price point; however, beyond the layer of shiny aesthetics and ridiculous physics is a fun fighting game accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. If you’re looking to get into the Dead Or Alive series, this would be a great place to start.",
"Ultimately the success of Samurai Warriors 4 Empires rests on how well it has been able to merge action and strategy together, and while I feel this veers strongly on the side of action, compared with even the Dynasty Warriors Empires series, there’s still enough thinky stuff to do between battles to add nuance to the overall experience.",
"Put that unfairness together with the annoying tendencies of the cops in Need for Speed Unbound, and the entire experience is full of peaks and valleys that curtail the progress that this game is supposed to be making. Beyond its art style that stands tall on its own, Need for Speed Unbound feels less like an innovation and more like a new body kit installed on an old engine. When the competition is already miles ahead, what this series needed was a nitrous boost of epic proportions, but sadly, it doesn’t seem like it will ever catch up.",
"The Elder Scrolls Online’s newest expansion give us new information about the lore of the franchise, while introducing an intriguing new class (the Necromancer) and a lot of endgame content.",
"The core gameplay remains solid with flashes of excellence and the game not only creates interest in the whole escape from Cybertron story, but creates excitement and a foundation for the inevitable sequel.",
"Calling delivers a great atmosphere, and it's really one of those games which will make shivers run down your spine; on the other hand, its basic gameplay and so-so graphics keep it from being a must-buy for survival horror fans.",
"A lot of fun (and weird storytelling choices) at a reasonable price, with no sweaty jungle of microtransactions, Concord has respect for both your time and your wallet. [Issue#45, p.92]",
"Aside from the minor visual issues, there is little to criticize about Darksiders II. The game is packed with content, is visually striking and features some brilliant level design. It expands on the mythology of the franchise, giving players a world that is both bigger and better than the original.",
"Onimusha: Warlords is a game from another era and the remaster, despite its many enhancements, sadly highlights how the experience hasn't aged too well. This doesn't mean that the game isn't good, as many of its ideas, such as combat, leveling system and puzzles, only required a few small tweaks to be truly excellent. The fact that it's a game from 2001 is clear when playing the game, but Onimusha: Warlords can still provide a sweet, albeit short, experience.",
"Legends of Eisenwald is missing this elusive, magical ""something"" that keeps you glued to the screen. Despite that this is a pretty good game that should appeal to fans of Heroes of Might and Magic - they could easily add some points to the final grade. Legends of Eisenwald is a good example of its genre.",
"I was treated to an excellent flight simulation, a deep level of customization, nice looking graphics and a sense of accomplishment when I was able to perform satisfactorily in some of the more challenging elements of the program (try formation flying).",
"Underneath the intriguing concept and gorgeous graphics, The Waylanders has a somewhat meaty tactical experience wrapped around the bare bones of an RPG. And while it may be light on the actual role-playing elements, there’s enough of a unique spin in terms of story, setting, and battle system that those who prefer mechanics above anything else might have a good time. This is by no means Baldur’s Gate nor Dragon’s Age: like King Ith’s Tuatha de Danaan, those gods aren’t here. I can recommend The Waylanders, but only if expectations are managed accordingly.",
"While we still admire the unique gameplay mechanics of Squad Assault, it certainly feels as though the series, as well as the technology, is being pushed a game too far with Second Wave.",
"All the visual improvement and added content can’t camouflage the handheld origins, which in return means that all the design and content shortcomings of the Vita version are still there.",
"This kart racer is for the Nickelodeon fans and families alike. It’s an approachable entry for newcomers as it has a lot of reimagined content from the first two games. It’s also accessible, with a low skill barrier for entry that admittedly can go surprisingly high for experienced players. There’s a lot of content to get through but you’ll have seen the best of it after a hours and it doesn’t stand out amongst its peers, outside of featuring a load of Nickelodeon IPs.",
"If you're the kind of gamer that likes to set two CPU-controlled combatants battle against each other in ""Street Fighter II"" and bet on the outcome with your friends, then this may be your type of game.",
"One of the best games I’ve played all year, and one of the best entries in the Need for Speed series. The driving is sublime, the cars are gorgeous, the art style is striking, and the soundtrack is exceptional. Despite falling short in a couple of facets, Unbound is a must-play racer.",
"We absolutely loved Final Fantasy VII Remake, but it's safe to say that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth surpasses it in every possible way. It's a masterpiece. It tells a grander tale, with more twists and turns that keep you on your feet. And while some new story elements may rub some players up the wrong way, they keep things feeling fresh, and make us keen to see where Square Enix will take things next. Ultimately, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has exceeded our expectations, building on the original game and indeed Final Fantasy VII Remake, delivering a sequel that feels bigger and better in all regards.",
"It's mainly the plot that makes this third chapter of the saga interesting, since the combat system is identical to the one of the previous episodes. If you got so far, you should consider this final chapter.",
Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet is a fun little game that does resemble any of the LEGO games that you may have played but it doesn't quite have the same charm and leaves you wanting more with a short story mode and only local co-op. Unless you are a mad Marvel fan or you are buying it for the kids then I would say give this a miss or wait until it comes down in price.,
"NSMBW is a stunning game in single-player, and a chaotic barrel of light-hearted laughs in multiplayer, accessible to beginners while truly challenging to long-term fans. Well done, Nintendo.",
"Dead or School’s combat can be fun in (very) short bursts, but it all ultimately falls flat hard and fast. It has the pacing of a freemium mobile game that’s dragging itself thin, begging you to spend money to speed it up. Except you can’t even do that to shorten your own suffering. With a larger budget and community feedback, I’m sure this team can deliver an excellent experience, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find that here.",
"As an adventure game Roki doesn't have much repeatability values, and some modern gamers might ignore it due to its 20$ price tag, but if you are willing to spend around 10 hours solving puzzles and stuff, Roki is probably a very good option for you.",
"All in all, The Thaumaturge is a game I won’t forget anytime soon. I even intend to play it again from the beginning as soon as Polish VO is added – and that’s something I didn’t declare for any title in a very, very long time.",
"AiRace Xeno could have been something special. The core idea of the game is fantastic and it’s a blast to pilot an aircraft an incredible speeds, but it’s ultimately a fleeting experience that’s confined to its limited features.",
"Resistance Burning Skies is the first FPS on PS Vita to use the game controls of an handheld device successfully, despite not being as good as Uncharted Golden Abyss or WipEout 2048 in terms of quality. The IP would have been better if the developers proposed more innovations as regards the level design, but the principal elements of the Resistance franchise have not been forgotten, espcially its multiplayer mode. For its first entry on PS Vita, Resistance Burning Skies copes pretty well.",
"Ash is a great character and this is one of the better $19.99 games out there but without Bruce being on board the way he needs to be, the game is sorely lacking that special something.",
"Fiendishly addictive to newcomers and realistic enough for advanced players, World Class Poker with T.J Cloutier is an essential purchase for anyone wanting to take their game further.",
"One of those games that you sit down to play for half an hour and end up spending whole night with. It’s not flawless (e.g. it lacks a multiplayer mode) but you will not regret investing time in it. [01/2014, p.50]",
"Despite being the best game in the series because of some lovely visuals and good gameplay enhancements, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire still manages to screw enough things up to be aggravating.",
FMA 2 does a grand job of portraying the boys as they are in the show and improves on the weaker elements of the first game to create an action adventure that is fun and easy to play. It's a real shame that it's so short.,
"Almost the opposite of its predecessor: a lesser story that isn't particularly well told, but with a staggering amount of exploration, side-quests, post-game content, and surprisingly deep mechanics.",
"While I won’t try and tell you this game serves as a replacement for Mass Effect or Fallout 3, it is pretty well done on the whole. I hope this means Radon Labs will be working on further RPGs, as Drakensang is a series with great potential.",
"South of Midnight is Compulsion's best game by a country mile, emerging as an assured and beautifully crafted Southern Gothic folktale that feels like a bracing breath of earthy, swampy air.",
"Tough but rewarding, the action in Hard West 2 benefits from the great role played by the element of luck and is supported by a strong pool of characters, with unique traits and abilities. Between its peculiar gameplay mechanics and its dark-hued West, the Ice Cold Games kids' game has hit the mark and we recommend it to all lovers of real-time strategy and to those looking for a challenge worthy of the name.",
"An understated, thoughtful game that is highly replayable and continually challening - the sort of game that will still be on your hard drive when all the other games you are playing right now are gathering dust on a shelf. [June 2003, p.78]",
A fairly bland and generic first person shooter experience that proves repetitive even in a single episode. It gives little reason to look forward to further installments of the series.,
"Fans of Secret will be sorely disappointed with this - but as we said, for all its failings, the 20 or so hours it takes to finish it are still enjoyable. It's just that the quality isn't as high as we expected. [NGC]",
"Monaco: What's Yours is Mine truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled ""Best Plan Ever"" complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying “Ready? GO!”, only to see it backfire in seconds.",
"The story is solid, if a little unusual for a Sherlock Holmes tale, and the collection of mechanics and mini-games that could easily feel thrown together actually work well together, leaving you guessing about what comes next.",
"When the action is go and events are in full swing, Mario & Sonic at the Sochi Winter Games is a flashy and fun mini-game compilation for all of the family. Like an Olympic athlete with an injury problem, however, it's more likely to be remembered as a game that never quite lived up to its potential.",
"By its very nature of being a sequel, Last Light doesn’t feel as fresh as Metro 2033 did, but there’s still nothing else like it. Few games generate immersion through gameplay and transport you to their world the way Metro does.",
A great game for one of the greatest gaming franchises based on superheroes. Batman: AK will surprise you from its beginning to its end in an adventure full of content and unforgettable moments.,
"Myths of the Eastern Realms does what a lot of expansions do: It condenses a larger, more expansive game into something quicker and more approachable. Being able to explore a new area and solve puzzles at a quicker pace can be fun, but without any strong new hooks, it's too stale to maintain much excitement for long and feels like a wasted opportunity to bring the world of Chinese myth to life.",
"Hard West 2 has some refreshing ideas to consider, such as perks based on your deck of cards, and consistently refreshing action points by way of kills. Unfortunately, its over-reliance on a puzzle-like, kill-all-in-one-round concept also leads to a repetitive and tedious romp as time wears on.",
"Who knew that, locked in the time-honoured traditions of Super Mario Bros., one of the greatest co-op games ever was waiting to get out? Well, Shigeru Miyamoto did. In unleashing it, Nintendo hasn't moved its classic series forward one jot; it hasn't had to. But it has given it a riotous new lease of life.",
"The game's missions were designed with portability in mind and the longest of them would only take an average person around 15-20 minutes to complete. Although with the short single-play, a long lasting multiplayer experience is always there waiting, granted you know a few other people with a copy of the game as well.",
"Those moments of anguish were not massive parts of the game, although they were gnarly roadblocks. Everything else, from the vibes to the storytelling, and even the combat when it was reasonable, were compelling to the end. I’m still curious about the other endings, but the trauma from that generator setpiece has me wanting to wait for possible adjustments or new settings in the future. Horror enthusiasts, especially those who revel in the weird, who are also secret gaming gunslingers and are cool with sudden spikes in difficulty will find a lot to like here.",
"RONIN is over in around seven to eight hours but the lengthy design of the levels makes it feel a lot longer than that. When you’re locked in a stalemate with ten armed guards, jumping around the walls to avoid gunfire is more tiresome than engaging. RONIN is good for a few short levels in your spare time, but I can’t fathom playing it for a long session.",
"Unless you happen to be an enemy of all things cool and funny, the first installment of Strong Bad is where it's at. This new monthly series shows tons of promise, and the next episode, Strong Badia the Free, looks even more delightfully ludicrous.",
"And if there’s one thing you can say about Dead Or Alive 5 Ultimate that you can’t say about another other fighting game, this is the only game where you can counter a punch, snap someone’s neck and boot them clean off a cliff in one swift move.",
"All of this adds up to a very feature rich game that deserves praise, it has taken the best bits from board games such as Scrabble, Risk and Boggle and mixed them up into a unique and satisfying experience. At 800 Points it would be more than worth it, however at just 400 Microsoft Points it is an absolute no brainer, go ahead and buy it right now.",
"All in all, I enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII-2 – it was a fun RPG game to play, looked spectacular and ate up a significant amount of my free time. It didn't give me everything I wanted out of the experience, but I still had fun.",
"Once you get a few levels into the game, you start to see the purpose and role of each weapon, and Constantine encourages you to think strategically about how to take down enemies.",
"Sine Mora EX doesn’t do much to differentiate between its older version. Apart from an added local couch co-op mode, new time attack variants, difficult challenge modes, and a boost in visuals, you’d be hard pressed to find anything out of the ordinary. I enjoyed the game more after playing it on a larger television screen because the game’s beauty and detail are done justice on a 55” screen as opposed to the smaller OLED on the Vita. Even if shmups are not your thing, passing on Sine Mora EX for that reason means missing out on a great, story driven side scrolling shooter that has style, maturity, and unexpected plot twists.",
"Dead Cells brings us a challenging adventure, full of action, which also merges several different genres. In the end, it provides a playable conflation as attractive as it is addictive.",
"Despite its mild pacing issues and occasional technical glitches, Game of Thrones is a wonderful representation of the gruesome HBO series and captures the harsh, unforgiving nature of the show that continues to shock all of us. It’s reinstated the GOT mottos: ‘there is no such thing as a happy ending’, and, ‘don’t get too attached to characters…because they’ll probably die…horribly’.",
"I mentioned before that Persona 4 Dancing All Night feels like a celebration of these characters. Yes, this is a fan-service game meant specifically for fans of Persona 4. That’s fine, but it’s also a legitimately fantastic rhythm game with a surprisingly great story mode.",
"Fans of the narrative should definitely pick this up, especially considering it was free as a pre-order bonus for some. Now I just hope that there will be more expansions for DmC and that a sequel gets greenlit. This is easily Capcom’s best franchise revitalization to date.",
"Anyone looking for a traditional Rock Band experience has the definitive one before them, packaged here with an optional and extensive set of educational devices that offer further reading for anyone who feels their virtual musicianship is ready to blossom and evolve into the real deal. [Christmas 2010, p.88]",
"Nice eye candy, but without any substance. The features that made the PC version so addictive and well balanced are all gone, and what remains is only a shell of the original game, which is little more than an unresponsive electronic sandbox.",
"Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star is a really weird game. As an action and Musou (Warriors) game works really nice albeit all of its and notorious flaws (THAT CAMERA!). As a Fate/ game, it doesn’t functions so well and lacks much of the essence that fans would want from it. It is a far from perfect title that you could find entertaining if you give it the opportunity. Just don’t expect it to offer something unique or different from what you have seen in many other Koei-Tecmo Games.",
"The Big Con is a charming little slice of nineties nostalgia. It's propelled by its strong writing and world-building, a deep understanding of the era it is referencing, and some fantastic characters, and it's certainly a road trip players will enjoy taking. Although its gameplay is limited and there are some technical issues, it's an earnest and compelling journey.",
"You should buy it because of the ridiculous courses, because of the energy level, because it&#146;s a racing game that really does overwhelm you and in a lot of ways challenges you to be smart and play with your head &#150; to a much greater extent than SSX.",
"The only other problem I found with the game was the challenge that the in-game camera presents. Often, you will find yourself using the camera buttons a lot to move the camera so you can see everything in the environment.",
"While the game has a bit of charm, that is mostly my affection for the title character coming through and not the actual game itself. The gameplay is dull and repetitive, the graphics and audio mediocre at best and the achievements are a complete drag.",
"The game is so story-driven that it becomes excessively linear. This is not to state that other action titles are so much more non-linear, but Eternal Darkness tends to have only one path through the whole game.",
"Griefhelm is a fun medieval skirmish game that fans of knights will enjoy, especially around the couch with friends. The potential of this lovingly crafted indie game is let down by some rough edges when it comes to close combat, as well as an unsatisfying single-player campaign.",
"Guardian Heroes is an idea long before its time. This high definition port embraces the past with its tweaks adding so much more enjoyment to the game, which will surely leave its loyal fan-base very happy indeed with the results. There are changes deemed only where necessary, and is made use of the 360 controller in its full. For 800 Microsoft points, this game is a bargain for fans of the late 90's classics.",
"An incredible mix of exploration, story, and setting, South of Midnight certainly resonated with me. While its individual parts mightn’t be groundbreaking, the way in which Compulsion Games has combined them certainly is. This is definitely one worth checking out.",
"Resistance: Burning Skies is an admirable effort but ends of leaving a lot to be desired. The game may carry the popular Resistance name, but the experience certainly doesn't mimic the standard(s) set by that previous entries in the series. Still, this is solid proof that the FPS-genre can succeed on a handheld system.",
"A Space for the Unbound sports an amazing narrative arc, capable of projecting itself towards an ending that will linger for a long time in the minds and the hearts of the players. This adventure deserves to be lived for its colours, for the atmosphere of the city and for its original narrative arc, under the sign of two brilliantly written female characters. We suggest you without reserve to play A Space for the Unbound if you know the English language.",
"Dicefolk is really all about the battles. If you’re looking for a full RPG experience, you’ll probably be disappointed. There’s not much to the story and very little world-building. However, strategy gamers are in for a treat. The unique battle mechanics provide for plenty of tactical depth, and there’s enough of a random element to keep you on your toes and make the battles more than just puzzles to be solved. The rogue-like elements and the randomness between runs work to keep things fresh. If you enjoy tactical games, but are a little burned-out on the turn-based RPG battle format, take Dicefolk out for a roll.",
"With a dash of humor and inspiration -- the two things Parallel Lines desperately needs -- this might have been a minor classic. Instead, it merely shows that attention to detail is nothing without a flash of life to drive the effort.",
"A pretty dry game that's a little too light on the action for people who don't like an equal dose of slowly paced strategy, but if you're as much into customizing your own ship as you are blowing other ships to pieces, Naval Ops: Commander might be for you.",
"Nicely presented (and there are no load times at all), it's packed with pure playability and has enough 'whimsical' substance to last just as long as the others. Fans of the previous games will relish the new challenges on offer, and anyone new to the series will no doubt have a whale of a time in multiplayer alone.",
Manages to accomplish more then you would expect with such a simple gameplay structure and limited environment. It doesn&#146;t break any new ground but fans of adventure games will find enough motivation to capture all 999 ghosts.,
"DOOM II is legendary, plain and simple. It's required gaming for any action/FPS gamer, and this XBLA release is extra special in that it has a new nine level episodes created by Nerve Software. Highly recommended.",
"MotoGP 13 is a fast and light racer that’ll please plenty of purists with its solid take on the sport. Newcomers on the other hand, might be left out in last place once the race has finished.",
"Despite a few minor complaints, largely concerning the bonus content, Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is an abundant, accessible and entertaining puzzle game that combines Nintendo craftsmanship with a competitive price tag.",
"Rollerdrome is a celebration of the mantra “easy to learn, hard to master”, except even the beginning stages require advanced levels of hand-eye-coordination that may challenge a more casual audience. Despite having various, commendable options for difficulty and accessibility, at the core, Rollerdome is aimed at a niche of hardcore players that love chasing highscore and chasing the elusive “perfect run”. While certainly not to everyone’s taste, Rollerdrome is absolutely stellar at what it does and lands its killer combo with a stylish presentation and a banging soundtrack.",
"The main problem is that there's just no sense of speed. You can be going Mach 1.2 and it feels like you're driving a charter bus. Uphill. Against the wind. In a foot of snow. Towing another charter bus. [Apr 2003, p.84]",
"While Madden 10 is our favorite football game of this generation, it suffers from trying to do too much. We love the new gameplay engine (more, please!) but could’ve happily done without most of the presentation “improvements” that get more irritating with each game.",
"It's the only real four-player, easy-to-learn game in the 360's library. If that's what you're looking for -- or you're a seven-year-old whose parents won't buy you Gears of War so you can use potty-mouth online -- then by all means rent Fuzion Frenzy 2.",
"If you're set on playing the original Age of Empires, this is far and away the best way to do so. That said, real-time strategy is a very feature-heavy genre. While this is the tightest the original AoE has ever been, it’s still sluggish and stripped-down compared to almost any modern offering.",
"While the new engine doesn't sport a consistent framerate and you can pretty much skip the Chi movie, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is a healthy enough serving of what's to come in Fragmentary Passage, and bundles in one amazing core entry that everyone should play.",
"Absolute Power will give you everything a good add-on has to give: a new single player campaign with some unusual scenarios, additional buildings and some improvements, but it doesn't reinvent the gameplay.",
"When all is said and done, Hellboy: The Science of Evil might have been a hit during the last generation of consoles. On the current consoles, though, it just falls short in nearly every regard.",
"If you want to feel like you're immersed in a heavy conflict, with combatants screaming commands, bullets zipping through the air and grenades exploding, Ghost Recon 2 is the game for you due to its powerful audio engine. The key weakness? The weapons sound like toys.",
"Killer is Dead functions decently, the art is occasionally nice, and it has shades of greater ideas, but beyond that I can't find a reason to spend money or time exploring its gradual deterioration.",
"Lost Records explores and depicts adolescence in a way that not only surpasses many games, but several works of media in general. It's no secret that we are inundated with ""coming-of-age"" stories, and as a fan of the cliche, I'd argue it's for good reason. The era between childhood and adulthood is one filled with hormones, emotions, self-discovery, lust, defiance, and experiences that ultimately shape the person you will become, shedding some semblance of your former self. Yet both the story that Lost Records explores and the one being shaped in the ""current"" time, in which women in their 40s come together and dispel the grating notion that women of that age are decrepit, matronly, and boring, do so in a way that feels fascinating, new, and important. As it stands now, Lost Records: Bloom and Rage is poised to be one of Don't Nod's greatest titles. Ultimately, however, much of the game's success is dependent upon the release of its second half, which is scheduled to release this April. It will take answers, action, and rewarded patience to stick the landing, but as of right now, I have faith that the team will do so.",
"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is the epitome of what a good spinoff title should be. While fictionally unrelated to the Ace Attorney games, it borrows heavily from the best aspects of that series while adding enough new game mechanics to make for a completely fresh gaming experience.",
"Melbits World is a nice attempt at creating a fun, simple puzzle game suited to PlayLink's smartphone functionality. Its visual style is very easy on the eye, while the basic, communication-based gameplay means it's bound to be a good family game. The PlayLink initiative may not have been as popular as Sony may have hoped, but Melbot Studios' title shows that there's plenty left to explore when it comes to smartphone controlled gaming.",
"From a gameplay perspective, this game rocks. The controls are easy to get the hang of after a while and unlike Resident Evil, where you move your stick is where your character goes.",
"None of Legendary Heroes' rough spots keep it from being an excellent game that I recommend with no reservations. Stardock has finally delivered on the promise that Elemental once held, back in the halcyon days of 2009. You don't have to be any kind of strategy savant to appreciate what this exceptional release has to offer.",
"If you are in the market for an RTS experience that will test your mettle and only lightly dent your online wallet, then Under Siege is a game you want to look into. Those wanting something that stays closer to the traditional formula of games like Starcraft won't find much comfort here.",
"Downsides do not outweigh the game's good sides, which are plenty: Solid gameplay design, nice voice overs, and a story that though clichéd, is presented in a way that intrigues you enough to keep going.",
"Despite the picturesque sights of the fictional Venice, Venetica is bleak and mediocre in everything, from two-bit quests and meager weapon selection to tiresome combat. Don't expect proper character development, because there are only four stats, two of which are health and mana. Don't expect colorful characters, because the entire city went through a copier two or three times. Don't expect brain-teasing puzzles, because there is only one variety: ""Push four buttons in a correct order"".",
"If you have a youngster looking to get into the groove of DDR, then this could be a great place to start. The theme is right up there alley, the levels get progressively harder so they will be able to challenge veteran players in the future, but with only 40 songs, you may find yourself getting another version of the game after a couple months.",
"If you have kids or a bunch of friends that get together for gaming nights, it's a decent party game that should entertain and embarrass. If you'll mostly be playing alone, it's not nearly as fun and gives little motivation to keep on playing after you've tried each game.",
"King of Seas is an average production, at times interesting, but that on the whole fails to involve players. Game dynamics soon become repetitive, the narrative struggles to take off and the artistic side could have been better. A real pity, since pirate games are never enough and the project was quite intriguing.",
"It's a pretty solid portable title, but it's definitely lacking that extra factor that the console titles have, where I feel like a complete powerhouse in the game and can mash buttons and mow down enemies until I get to a boss encounter.",
"While there isn't the sense of playing something that opens up a new era for a genre long written off as dying, there is a simple freshness and a delightful accessibility which might endear it to an even wider market. [July 2004, p.106]",
"While its overly long story mode amounts to a tragic waste of resources, Persona 4: Dancing All Night's strongest qualities can be found in just how well the series' pop art aesthetic meshes with the rhythm game genre. This might not be the most complex or inspired take on rhythm games to date, but DAN certainly knows how to have a good time.",
"If you have enjoyed previous Sonic games but were hesitant to pick this one up because of the most recent Sonic outings, worry no more. Sonic Colors is worth the price of admission.",
"Given the scope of what it tries to cover, Liberation HD could’ve easily been as complex and lengthy as its home-console siblings. Instead, this somewhat-confusing adventure gets you to love it, and then leaves you yearning for more.",
"Games should sometimes only be judged by the fact of weather they're fun or not. Well, lads, Reality Fighters is fun. It has a simplistic gameplay but it's just fun so enjoy the ride.",
"Plagued with flaws, this game could be at least decent if it only had a grain of charm. Somehow it misses all the elements it needs to have in order to be the game it wants to be, and can only appeal to the hardest of hardcore fantasy lovers out there.",
"If shoving Toonami and the Titanfall 2 Pilot’s Gauntlet into a blender and turning it to the highest speed sounds like a good time, then Neon White might be what you’re looking for. It’s a blood-pumping, speed-infused anime shooter with style and a decent bit of heart. While it’s short and sweet, Neon White gives just enough to get the player keen on shaving off seconds and fractions of seconds until they are, indeed, a speedrunning freak. For anyone who likes to go fast, that’s at least worth the price of admission.",
"Derivative to say the least, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death clearly owes God of War for many of its characteristics. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining ride while it lasts and a good example of how, sometimes, action games can lean just on their button-mashing basis to be fun.",
"An uneven effort, MotoGP '08 is a decent game that should please most newbies and occasional riders but proves that Milestone has a ways to go before it fully grasps the handlebars.",
"There are endless hours of replayability built into this package. With its gorgeous visuals, head bobbing audio tracks, and addictive action, I would recommend Electronic Symphony to anyone even remotely interested in puzzle games.",
One cannot comprehend who Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is meant to serve. Exploration is a chore based on frame rate issues and less-than-stellar graphics. Questing sucks because there is no real sense of progress or accomplishment. Farming and crafting is similarly pointless as there just isn’t a heck of a lot to do. I will confess to giving up after only a couple of hours in hopes that I was the recipient of Alpha code.,
"It's ironic how a product called ""Unbound"" is, in contrast, still so harnessed by the canons of traditional open world racing games, resulting all too similar to its direct predecessor. Need For Speed Unbound is a solid title overall , provided, however, that you approach it without too many pretensions. Net of some structural problems that can make you turn up your nose, the game manages to entertain, thanks to a deep customization of the vehicles and a multiplayer that works properly. The original sin, however, lies in the wanting to insist on a slightly lazy playful formula. production that unfortunately does not deviate from the trend that starts from Burnout Paradise and links all the Need For Speed released in the last decade, son of a repeated life a little indolent. There is therefore a need for Electronic Arts to get back on track and engage the turbo as soon as possible, if it wants to return to excel in the panorama of arcade driving games.",
"Beyond some frustrating gameplay, Night of 100 Frights brings the visuals and sounds of the long running cartoon to life in this title, with a huge map to explore on your way to solving the mystery.",
"Like a once-great champ who's come out of retirement for one last crack at the title, C&C3: Tiberium Wars doesn't quite have enough tricks in its repertoire to defeat its younger, fresher opponents. But while it may be more contender than king these days, it still packs one hell of a punch. [May 2007, p.62]",
"A unique, immersive mystery adventure game that is a standout in its genre. The amount of detail present in nearly every aspect of the game makes for a challenging but accessible puzzle solving experience. The game brilliantly combines time-loop mechanics with clever and mysterious puzzles that will put you on wit’s end, while smoothly balancing a creepy plotline with a colorful art style and dry humor. This indie title is a hidden gem that fans of mystery and puzzle games alike will greatly enjoy.",
"Falls flat. The fundamentals may be here, but the things that make the Assassin’s Creed series so good don’t get the necessary space here, or just feel half-done. If you were looking forward to Liberation as your next Assassin’s fix after the brilliant Black Flag, you’ll be thoroughly disappointed.",
"The game feels perfectly designed for a handheld thanks to its time and mission structure, meaning you can speed through a loop in just a few hours on your journeys. Majora’s Mask is brilliant, and disappointingly still the most innovative Zelda game ever released.",
"RockBand 3 is a revolution on its own when it comes to all of the new elements Harmonix Introduced. It's a posh revolution, due to the high price of admittance. Do your maths and decide for your own!",
"Of all of the Vita launch titles I have been fortunate enough to play, this is honestly the easiest one to recommend. Accessible, fun, addictive, and offering lots of content, Lumines: Electronic Symphony is a superb launch title.",
"In the end, Gears of War 2 achieves exactly what it sets out to do: make a better Gears of War. It's an accomplishment worthy of praise, but knowing what Epic is capable of, we really wish they would have pushed the envelope a bit more on the campaign mode.",
"This is a great approach to the GTA concept, with extremely fun and different missions, and a wise use of the GamePad functions. If you really like the genre, you shouldn't miss this opportunity.",
"Despite an almost abandoned lobby when trying to play online, something tells me that Monster Hunter Freedom has so much more to offer once a larger community of gamers get hold of it.",
"If this is the way EA is going to approach the development of their sports games, then perhaps the next college football game they release should be ""NCAA Football 08."" At least it would save me $50.",
Marlow Briggs and the Mask of the Death is an honest hack'n slash game with varied action and nice combat system. What it lacks in style and in the technical department is fully compensated for by the overall quality of the action.,
"Rollerdrome is a beautiful creation. It’s DOOM Eternal meets Tony Hawk with thoughtful political ruminations and an art style to die for. We’re only about ten or fifteen bad years from a sport like this actually existing, so you might as well practice.",
"A kid who loves the TV show might find Transformers Animated: The Game amusing for a little while, and some adults might enjoy the more challenging puzzles. However, most players who aren't blinded by love for Transformers will probably find this title a bit boring. There are better games like this out there.",
"A dodgy camera and touchy controls can be fixed. I know I wasn't the only one at E3 who told the producer that the camera was a mess. But, alas, they shipped this most stylish and most gore-riffic game with its major problems still intact.",
"Commandos 2 HD has had a fresh lick of paint and a nice polish but that's about it. It would have been nice to bring something new to the table in terms additional missions or new commandos. In today's world of video games, It just does not hold up against its peers. I do look forward to the planned 3rd installment they have mentioned. This is also due out on consoles in spring 2020 and hopefully, this title will have more modern bells and whistles attached to make it more appealing.",
"Despite the 3D graphics, Tropico 3 is basically the same game like the first version eight years ago. A lot of things are not up to date, but the mix of politics, economy, development and black humor is ageless. If you liked the first Tropico, you will love the new one.",
"MC II should ship with a free sample of Ritalin. The amount of concentration required to maintain control of your car at such incomprehensibly high speeds almost requires some sort of chemical assistance (just joking kids). [June 2003, p.66]",
"Roki starts off as a straightforward narrative-focused adventure, and while it looks the part, the game is more of a traditional puzzle title, with a few of the typical downfalls of the genre.",
"The thrill of learning in Loop Hero is the driving force of its procedural gameplay, with each small discovery and minute change in approach producing outcomes you might not have imagined. Its opening hours are a punishing hurdle to overcome, but once you've found the rhythm of Loop Hero, you won't want to break from its beat.",
"While the second and third games are arguably better, Onimusha: Warlords serves as a perfect introduction to one of Capcom’s most underrated franchises. So many minor improvements have been made here to make the game very playable by modern standards, though the fixed camera angles will remain polarising with modern audiences. Regardless, Onimusha: Warlords is a brief yet rewarding experience that combines simple yet satisfying combat and ghoulish enemy designs to create something that’s still unique.",
"If you’re a fan of the series, you want to support the HD Remaster, but at the same time it’s had a rough go out of the gates that might give you pause. I’d recommend keeping an eye on this one and seeing what develops, but RTS fans should definitely make it a point to play this series if they haven’t yet.",
"FPS snobs often talk smack about the TimeSplitters franchise for lacking sophistication and for being a bit silly, but the key to its success has always been that it puts fun ahead of any pretension. If that's what you value most, you could do far worse.",
"I think Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder is pretty fantastic, and well-worth playing. I was genuinely surprised that a sequel was even made, but I’m happy to see that ACE Team managed to recapture all of the magic from the first, and expand on it even more.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition is definitely one of the most solid and convincing RPG experiences of the entire Nintendo Switch line-up, as well as a must-have for lovers of the genre.",
"This is a game for fans of the franchise, maybe not the best of these remixes, but definitely enjoyable and a great option to keep us entertained while we wait for Kingdom Hearts III.",
"Watery additions aside, the rest of the game is pretty much business as usual. The parks need cleaners and repairmen to keep the rides running, and the punters need well-placed ATMs and stalls to shop at.",
"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a great game and manages to go one better than its great predecessor. Due to the enormous scope of Rebirth, the first game feels more like a small prologue and now the game has really begun. Despite its scope, we never got bored for a second. The game is more versatile and varied than we have experienced for a long time. We were literally thrilled by the new gameplay elements that constantly presented us with new challenges. Then there are the great characters and the gripping story, which touched us again and again with emotional moments.",
"If you’ve ever loved the series before, make this a part of your collection ASAP, and if you’ve been turned off by it before, at least try the free-to-play game out to see if you like the gameplay mechanics.",
The return of one of the vicars in the RTS genre is a mix between nostalgic memories and learning how to manage your rage. The same problems that in 90s were the norm now are huge problems that can make you shout at your citizens.,
"There is still work to be done on this series; the physics still need work and the difficulty still needs to be more carefully balanced. However, it's hard to hate any aspect of this game, even the parts that don't work so well, as it's the most successful attempt yet at recapturing the magic of the original games.",
"It's a great little game -- chock full of humor, gameplay twists, and top-notch voice work that's closer to what film fans love Bruce Campbell for: It's not grade A, but it makes up for it in personality.",
"With this episode the Myst series goes out in respectable fashion. There's still nothing on offer for anyone that craves action, exhilaration or an easy ride but frankly that's no great surprise.",
"The changes made could have easily spelt a disaster in the GR series, but they've been skilfully handled and form the basis of a good, solid shooter that's entertaining and tough without being overly difficult.",
"Madden NFL 10 may well be the best Madden game. This is a great pickup for any football fan. Franchise mode is great this year. A lot more features added to give you a more in depth look at your team, and what is happening around the league. Online franchise is a great addition.",
"But if you move through the settings from easy to normal to hard to very hard, you've got a challenging shooter that is as graphically appealing and fun as any out there--except, of course, for ""Radiant Silvergun.""",
"If I had to describe Splatoon 2 in a word it would be ""fun"". The game's new modes are fun, the new weapons are great and the game's performance are incredible, whether we're talking about the 60 FPS mark the game stays on or the stability of the servers. The game could do more in regards to its online lobby system, but everything else is pretty much spot on. Splatoon 2 is a must own for the Nintendo switch.",
"A spiritual successor to the Zeno Clash franchise, Clash: Artifacts of Chaos preserves and extends those games’ trademark weirdness. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos takes some chances and adds some interesting mechanics to the action game formula. Not everything works, unfortunately, and the game can be striking, engrossing, and frustrating in equal measure. I loved the game’s singular art direction, day/night mechanic, and more, but the combat is a mixed bag. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is almost, but not quite, worth playing for its art alone.",
"While I'd have a hard time recommending this game to casual fans of racing, those that like steep, technical challenges will be thrilled, as will fans of the sport. I want to be clear, though. You will have to have a lot of patience and time on your hands to make F1 2013 a rewarding experience. It's tough.",
"With Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance Platinum Games and Kojima Production worked in perfect harmony creating a fine piece of art. Fast and excellent gameplay hugs Kojima's elegant, intense and detailed storytelling. Few technical issues and a bunch of bad design choices ruin the experience, but the final result is still greatly entertaining.",
"Concord is a bland, personality-less hero shooter that was a good few years late to the party, yet failed to build on the achievements of its predecessors and insisted on doing everything its own way, with very poor results.",
"It's impossible to recommend Soldier of Fortune: Payback to new players or fans of the series, like me, who have been waiting for a sequel since Double Helix on the PC, especially when titles such as Call of Duty 4 are available for the same or similar price and deliver a far better experience in every way.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a good game on which you can have fun and spend good moments. Whether you are a new player or an old player of the license, you will find what you need. However, you will have to be patient to get through some stages. With this opus, Sega invites players to rediscover their first love of the series by offering levels from the first Super Monkey Ball. As a bonus, the addition of mini-games is a plus to have fun with your friends during parties even if some mini-games are not necessarily the most exciting. As for the small drawbacks, we regret the fact that you can't play all the characters in all the modes or the difficulty which is not always progressive.",
"A quality party game, so it's a real shame that the biggest new feature - the Quest mode - is so poor. And good though it is, it's only worth getting if you missed the previous one or you're an obsessive completist. [April 2006, p.86]",
"Rollerdrome is an action game smartly mixed rollerskating and shooting. While the fast, exciting action and retro style OST are impressive, relatively scarce volumes and cartoon rendered visuals can be divided into likes and dislikes.",
"Of course, the story is what drives this game forward, but it's the perfect blend of platforming elements and action-shooting that are so good, feel so right -- and with guns that feel so good -- that in the end, I don't give a damn what genre this game actually falls under.",
"It’s not often we see a Game of the Year contender so early in the year, but here we are. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an unforgettable follow-up to one of the finest remakes ever produced. Deftly building upon the rock-solid foundation of its predecessor, it evolves the combat and progression systems in subtle yet exciting ways while setting you loose in a massive world that you’ll want to explore to the fullest. With countless activities to keep you busy and a gripping story that will leave both Final Fantasy VII veterans and newcomers alike on the edge of their seats, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an unmissable adventure.",
"I personally could have done without the majority of the hovercar and weapon-based missions, but overall the game works well, looks and sounds fantastic, and provides many hours of mostly enjoyable gaming.",
"Ronin is fun, innovative, and worth a go – especially if your tastes lean toward both strategy and cool ninja high jinks – but there is untapped potential here that could have resulted in a serious Steam standout.",
"In conclusion Blade Kitten is a mixed bag, providing some fluid platforming with mediocre combat. Whilst the game never really blows you away, it never stoops to being anywhere near terrible. It's certainly unfortunate that Kit's first outing is one that is very forgettable and brimming with repetition, as there is certainly potential here.",
"You might have some fun if all you care about is channeling your grade-school hacky-sack sessions, but if you're looking to actually play street soccer, you'll wonder why your soccer pitch turned into a circus act. [Apr 2006, p.77]",
"Those Who Remain leaves much to be desired and never pays off, no matter how many notes you read. Sure, there’s a decent narrative to discover within the game’s dark themes, but that is overshadowed by the sloppy structure and poor control scheme. It’s a shame because I really felt like there would be some kind of pay off at the end of this supernatural mystery, but I was left in the dark.",
"It takes the traits of what made the Travellers' Tales LEGO games so well loved in the first place, such as the good-natured humor, and it does so without a license as a crutch. The story is good, but it is the multitude of activities that really makes this title shine and gives you plenty of reasons to explore every nook and cranny after Rex Fury is behind bars once again.",
"EA Sports FC 25 offers a very complete experience that comes from presenting an overwhelming amount of content, accompanied by several improvements in different modes, although I think there is still a lot of room for improvement. Essentially, it is a very good game that is limited by a recurring problem: the weight of microtransactions in Ultimate Team.",
"Age of Wonders 4 is a triumph of a game, and an easy recommend for any players looking for a fun 4X game. There is a lot to celebrate here, and the number of options the player has makes for many hours of content to look forward to. A couple of problems here and there do raise their heads, but overall there is an extremely strong and well crafted game to look forward to for any who are tempted to give it a try.",
"It’s hard not to bring nostalgia into it. I can ignore those quibbles I have because of the countless times this game made me feel something, whether that be anger, joy, sadness, or empathy. As I rolled the credits I realised this was exactly the game I’ve wanted to play since I was 17 years old. It’s playing one of my favourite games all over again, experiencing everything fresh - and loving it just as much as I did over two decades ago.",
"Trek to Yomi is a story of loss, honour and revenge. Despite some technical issues and a combat system with unbalanced combos, it's undoubtedly a game suited for all feudal Japan fans.",
"Iron Man is a typical movie game. The game has outdated graphics, repetitive gameplay and unsatisfying controls. Almost everything in this game feels wrong. Even the official licenses and soundtrack don't do the game justice. Even Marvel fanatics should stay far away from this product.",
"While it's inarguable that Ridge Racer was very much in need of a makeover, Unbounded's formula is far from the required antidote. The focus on destruction has overshadowed everything else to the point where other elements are merely along for the ride. It's all well and good designing a game with a specific focus in mind, but not when that focus renders everything else pointless.",
"It may be easy to accuse sports games of offering the same experience year in and year out, but you simply can’t say that about NBA 2K23. The game still has issues with its overemphasis on microtransactions in MyCareer and to a lesser extent MyTeam, but the new MyNBA Eras mode is a revelation – and the Jordan Challenge campaign is damn fun, too. On the court, 2K Sports has made some nice balancing tweaks and also improved the overall AI to make matches more dynamic and competitive, and when you pair all of that with all the new animations, you end up with a basketball sim that’s the very definition of a slam dunk.",
"NBA 2K23 shines this year on next-gen and positions itself as one of the best episodes of the license released so far. A gargantuan content, a neat technique, a gameplay much more faithful to the real thing, winks every 5 minutes for NBA fans, a less fraudulent My Team mode and a very positive NBA League Pass offer for the players. However, we can't ignore the differences between the current-gen and next-gen versions given the prices displayed... It is urgent that 2K wakes up and stops this unequal practice towards the players by proposing similar versions or at adequate prices according to what is offered to the players. This 2023 vintage is back on the throne of sports simulations by advocating excellence in the image of an ever more legendary Michael Jordan.",
"Revengeance is one of the most surprising hack'n'slash titles of this generation. Years ago, nobody would have imagined a game like this within the franchise, and Platinum Games is giving us everything we wanted with it.",
"The game looks phenomenal. Vivid colors blanket the backgrounds and characters alike, and the detail work, from waving grass to rippling waterfalls, is remarkable. While the plot and humor at play here rarely reaches for anything beyond immature power fantasy, the gameplay package is far more than you (or I) would have expected.",
"To call Sonic Colours the best 3D Sonic game ever is damning with faint praise, although its title is deserved. The action is fast enough to satisfy your speed lust, whilst the Wisp powers introduce plenty of new skills and ways to explore the stages that otherwise could just be straight zips to the finish.",
"Capcom has come to PSVita UMVC3 well. The game is almost as large and deep as the major versions, and just as fun. Sony's new console comes with a good fighting game with this crossover.",
"Not changing a damn thing about your initial game formula in over seven year means you are either an extremely lazy designer or that the formula is so genius it doesn't need to be changed. Luckily designer Mizuguchi is anything but lazy and Lumines is still a winner. [March 2012, p.58]",
"This game is definitely not a good demonstration of what the camera is capable of, and for people who didn't graduate from EyeToy University, this game could be enough to put them off of motion-based gaming indefinately.",
Omen of Sorrow is an intriguing fighter whose simplistic AI is surprisingly accommodating for newcomers. Fighting is easy enough to grasp but a healthy online community could help providing some impressive bouts. The story and presentation lacks some punch but the varied and nuanced characters help provide some fascinating match-ups. There are some rough edges but there's satisfying combat to pull you through.,
"And so rather than allowing you to feel like an armoured avenger, Iron Man's videogame outing merely offers the chance to lurch awkwardly around the sky like a drunken wasp while holding down a button to blow stuff up.",
It’s literally an Action-RPG with Harvest Moon elements. Not to mention the atmosphere of the game is very well created with the feeling that you actually are in a world of dinosaurs and there is a chance you will die.,
"Pac-Man World may not be Pac-Man World 2 like I’d hoped, but it’s still a solid classic platformer with enough unique elements to help it stand out. Those who have played the original will no doubt appreciate the nostalgia, but those like me who missed it originally will still have a good time.",
"Without a story or even a philosophy to fall back on, Ovivo is forced to stand on its gameplay, its art, and its music. At times, those all sync up and produce a flowing, memorable meditative experience. Mostly, though, the zooming and fiddliness get in the way of the art, or the dull bits of the art get in the way of the experience. For a truly minimalist and meditative experience, ditch the game and just grab the soundtrack.",
"If Harmonix Music VR sounds like your jam, it probably is. Plopping on the helmet after eating your favorite comfort food can make for a really relaxing afternoon, but the other modes aren't even worth the time of day.",
"Wattam’s fascination with connection could have been better served if had a stronger story to back it up. Perhaps it could have been a kid-friendly, significantly less convoluted version of Death Stranding if it fleshed out its narrative just a bit more in the right ways.",
"While cheesy flight simulation goes back to the original PC, this incarnation's technical detail brings CNN's gee-whiz graphics-and-stats fighter plane descriptions&#151;indicative of our fascination with death from above&#151;to life.",
"New players may find all the back story and references from XIII a bit confusing, however with the inclusion of a ""beginner's primer"" in the menu, there's no reason why longtime fans of the series as well as complete newcomers won't get a brilliant gaming experience out of this title. Two thumbs up!",
"The Stronghold series isn't like Total War, doing a hundred different things; it just needs to get the castles and combat right. On the evidence of Stronghold Crusader 2, Firefly is moving in the right direction, but it still has a way to go.",
"Whereas other shooters may have a 'just one more go' factor to them, the careful build-up to events in Ghost Recon 2 can crush the will of the less-dedicated gamer when it comes to repeating the same level for the fifth time. Even the addition of a save anywhere feature doesn't quite remove the teeth-grindingly annoying aspect of playing certain levels.",
"The world of Venetica is beautiful and unique, but it suffers from some serious technical issues and an overall lack of polish. Still, with its fun, fast paced combat, good atmosphere and engaging quests it's a fine gaming experience nonetheless and a solid recommendation for those who are not looking for an all to deep role playing experience.",
"If you are looking for a top-down car combat racer with a ton of content for a relatively low cost this could be a title to check out, but if you are looking for a well polished game that does not need a number of hours to crack the surface, you should probably pass.",
"Age of Wonders 4 is a great title that will have you wanting to play only one more turn, and only one more round, as you unlock things in Pantheon progress and decide to play one more match.",
"This tears your skin off! Fast gameplay, customisable upgrades and lots of style – despite the repetitive action, Wolverine definitely is the best game incarnation of our favorite super-hero.",
"The Thaumaturge is a deep, complex and expertly crafted RPG game. Ripe with engaging, layered stories that enthral and disgust in equal measure, this depiction of Warsaw overrun with the flaws of human nature is supremely compelling. It may be slightly too long and has the odd technical flaw, but this is a world worth delving into, a character study of the human condition brimming with intrigue. An excellent video game that may surprise some as a potential game of the year contender.",
"Rather austere in its presentation, and repetitive in its gameplay, Foretales unpacks an intriguing story via its roguelite storytelling, which has you throwing game after game, but in moderation. You'll want to achieve one good ending at least.",
"Dark Sector is bipolar rollercoaster ride that tops out at gorgeous, innovative, and striking (glaive, visuals, virus powers) and bottoms out at a bland, unoriginal, and buggy (gunplay, storyline, melee attacks). The extremes are both high and low, but at least Digital Extremes has a solid base moving forward to the inevitable sequel.",
"Fallen Legion: Sins of an Empire is one of the most promising action RPGs that I've seen in a long time but its reliance on repetitive battles will surely wear down any genre fan's enthusiasm quicker than Cecille can say ""Cassandra's Coil!""",
"Jurassic World Evolution was never a perfect game, but there were some fans of the Jurassic Park franchise that felt it was worth their time. Despite the shallow simulation aspects and repetitive tasks forced on them, many players still enjoyed creating and admiring the various dinosaurs in their park. Because of the poor graphics on the Nintendo Switch version of Jurassic World Evolution, however, there is little here to keep players entertained - and those interested in the premise are better off revisiting its previous platforms instead.",
"Stronghold Crusader 2 understands the art of the troop blob, but that alone doesn't make it a good game. Its lack of interesting units, underdeveloped castle-building options, and terrible tutorials hold the game back. Blob warfare is still fun, and directing an army never gets old. But man cannot live on blob alone.",
"A surprisingly fun little game that challenges you with some cool puzzles and sends you through a nicely lit, often-interesting mansion. Despite some problems with control and a little bit of an awkward camera, I was quite entertained most of the time.",
"Long time Homestar Runner fans will be pleased to see that all the major characters they've come to know (Marzipan, The Cheat, Coach Z, Pom Pom, etc.) are included along with many inside jokes.",
"Final Fantasy XII revives my love of the Final Fantasy series and proves why the series is one of the best in the world. I would say that this game’s only real competition for RPG of the year would be ""Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.""",
"The Shrouded Isle is a perfect game if looking for something quick and easy to play. With simple mechanics that only require the pointing and clicking of a mouse, a narrative that is heavy handed but deeply satirical, it’s easy to get on board. The Shrouded Isle doesn’t ask a lot from the player because it knows it’s delivering a finite ending. The beauty is that each game is relatively quick and the longest it takes to close out the three years is a little over half an hour. It would be nice if it was accompanied by a few more menus or ways to look back on certain stats but it doesn’t hinder the game. Who knew being the High Priest of a sacrificial cult could be so fun?",
"The no-frills adventure portion of the title offers a twist on the exciting fighting formula, although the unpolished reliance on platforming might turn off players who are looking simply to crack some skulls as the orange-clad Hokage hopeful.",
"As for the adventure, it demands to be savored and not discussed. Amazing graphics power gorgeous cut-scenes filled with sky-choking ships, huge vaguely futuristic cities, and stunning natural landscapes. And, as beautiful as it looks, it plays even better.",
"Foam Sword has advertised Knights and Bikes as a Goonies-inspired adventure, but nostalgia is a tricky beast. A game steeped in imagination born from childhood memories requires the player to commit to this vision to get the most out of its story. Foam Sword’s attempt to pitch this vision of nostalgia and childhood as a universal one is not entirely successful – largely because memories and cultural experiences are not universal. Knights and Bikes did entirely not captivate me. That said, its sincere leading characters and exquisite art are certainly aspects to be admired.",
"King of Seas is a game that knows how to be entertaining right from the start, and that will put your pirate skills to the test. Something more could have been done with regards to dialogues and soundtrack, but these flaws do not hamper the enjoyability of King of Seas, which also offers a good amount of replayability.",
"Yonder is beautiful and relaxing, but only up to a certain point. It's great for the first few hours, wandering around and discovering new sights, but the world ultimately leaves you wanting more depth and personality to explore.",
"Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 incorporates a bunch of new modes and switches up the songlist, but for many less-than-expert players will seem a little too similar to previous games.",
"After a slow, boring start Fall of Cybertron turned out to be solid and varied. You have to give it a chance and see a couple of robots in action to fully appreciate what at first seems to be just another simple shooter. [10/2012, p.60]",
"Monster Energy Supercross 25 isn’t all that different from Monster Energy Supercross 6, which wasn’t all that different from Monster Energy Supercross 5, and so on. There are small improvements across the board which make it the best entry in the series to date, though, which should make it worthwhile purchase for fans of the sport. Newcomers should just be aware that it’s pretty uncompromising, demanding some serious effort to master.",
"Those that have fond memories of GTA past and a deep patience for moving a bit backwards in the control and visuals department will be fine here, with familiarity and a good deal more than two dozen plotline missions to complete.",
"Superhot: Mind Control Delete’s focus on improvisation and rogue-lite elements excellently complement its “time moves only when you move” core gameplay loop and distinctive aesthetic, making it a first-person shooter that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.",
"Legends of Eisenwald will certainly offer tens if not hundreds of hours of fun for those who are willing to understand its world and mechanics, and it will be interesting to see how the team at Aterdux expands the formula of the game in the future.",
"Despite some hefty potential, Shovel Knight: Showdown doesn’t quite make it. It’s good, don’t get me wrong, and there’s some great ideas, but anyone who hasn’t played a Shovel Knight game is going to find themselves quickly alienated in a party situation. So, if you and your friends are up to date with your royally appointed warriors, you… probably already own this game, since it’s free with Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. If you’re not, consider yourself warned, although to be honest this is good enough to likely still have some fun. Shame there’s no online, though.",
"Though the Turtles may have aged almost 20 years, their look is as sharp and clean as when they first jumped out of the sewers. From the crazy animated ninjitsu moves to the colorful levels, the Turtles never looked so good on a small screen.",
"An honest, sometimes even painful, story about friendship and finding yourself. Life is Strange is played with a lump in the throat and its ability to make a grown man tear up is its true ""power"".",
"Gears of War 2 is one of the greatest games of the year and if you're even remotely interested in its genre and do not own an Xbox 360, then seriously consider getting one - it is THAT good.",
American Nightmare is different from the original game in almost everything. Yet it is a fine piece that you shouldn't miss not only for the great story and surprising ending. [March 2012],
"Arma 3 is as much a tool as it is a game, and it is by far the best tool Bohemia has created so far. Its not perfect though, and it's still a product for a very specific audience. I wish a few compromises had been made to make it more accessible and fun.",
"South of Midnight is a refreshing and satisfying action-adventure that has all of the trappings and nostalgia of the classics of yesteryear, yet has all of the bells and whistles you’d associate with modern gaming.",
"South of Midnight is a stunningly beautiful and moving experience. While the gameplay doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, it combines excellent writing and music to move your soul in ways only the best games can. This title is an enormous step-up for Compulsion Games, and I hope this isn’t the last we see from Hazel Flood.",
"Drakensang's best not when it's being played, but when it's being tinkered with. It's an old-fashioned, sometimes archaic, other times deeply engrossing game that rewards and satisfies according to how much effort you're willing to put in.",
"It's action-packed gameplay; attractive, colorful visuals; and star-studded videos are sure to draw in both hardcore fans of the series and large numbers of new players. [Apr 2007, p.20]",
"As an attempt to create an old school game Might & Magic Heroes VI did not sweep me off my feet. It tries to bring back the old days and sometimes it does succeed but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I'm spending too much time with it and getting not enough fun in return. [November 2011, p.52]",
"The Settlers: New Allies is a basic and easy RTS. Unfortunately, the game has no complexity for an RTS which hinders advanced strategies and even “cheese” mechanics. The campaign is forgettable, and the skirmish mode offers little in variety, not to mention the horrible multiplayer stability. I was very hopeful for a new Settlers game but got a “Babies first RTS” instead.",
"A high quality re-package that gives series newcomers the best bang for their buck while remaining lots of fun for competitive and casual gamers alike. Still, the Ultimate edition perks aren't substantial incentive for current Dead or Alive 5 owners.",
"Despite being feeling and looking somewhat familiar (which is definitely a positive in this case), New Super Mario Bros. Wii is one of your safest and best bet on the Wii this year.",
"With amazing improvements and incredible gameplay, FFXII is without a doubt the best Final Fantasy game in over a decade. Put simply, this is what all RPGs, regardless of platform or subject matter, should aspire to be.",
"When I do play, I enjoy Forge, but I wish that I was playing an MMORPG with the same gameplay setup instead. In the end, unless you're someone heavy into shooters who is looking for something different yet familiar, or are into MMOs for the PvP mainly, then it would be worth waiting for the game that will be ""forged"" a few months down the road.",
"GripShift’s one of those marmite games. You’ll either fall in love with the weighty physics and adore the time based collection challenges. Or you’ll detest the numerous restarts, and missing out on progression by a mere split second.",
"Röki is like a sort of an evolution of the point and click genre, an adventure game far less overelaborate but still interesting and intriguing, only in a different, more accessible way which heavily lean on exploration. A journey of discovery and at the same time an intimate story and a folklore's tale.",
"With quirky graphics, familiar sounds, a nice variation in missions and tasks, a high level of interaction where jobs are concerned and some great new power socials, The Urbz is a worthy addition to most peoples' collection.",
"The Max's journey ends with this fifth episode and she knows she has achieved many good ideas but, for the way, she also has left other important things. Life is Strange is classic and fresh at the same time, but Dontnod Studios should have had more money to develop an unforgettable game.",
"A lot of fun. It’s just that there’s not much here to keep the fun going unless you head online for the leagues or tournaments. While for the latest installments in an established series, it’s a bit of a disappointment. For the first installment of a promising, new series, it’s a pretty good start.",
As annoying as the high tolerance level and missing error analysis are: Just Dance 2014 is the best rhythm game when it comes to the pure joy of moving to music – especially in a group.,
"Loop Hero is yet another stunning gem that fans of the rogue-lite genre will enjoy. It’s a blend of so many different types of games that it becomes a completely unique entity on its own, and it’s hard to think of anything else that offers an experience quite like this one. It’s a game that forces you to trust in your own decisions, commit to them, and either reap the rewards or face the consequences. There’s no control, and that’s the beauty of this game.",
"Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce is a good attempt to innovate with the franchise, introducing some RPG elements and, with a more flexible action component, the experience offered is quite new. The good multiplayer mode helps in the longevity department. Unfortunately the badly calibrated difficulty level makes the game more oriented to be played in cooperative mode, leaving the singleplayer disadvantaged.",
"In expected fashion the puzzles become increasingly difficult, demanding careful timing and sound logical thinking--navigating the fish through most of the stages is thoroughly enjoyable. [Apr 2008, p.73]",
"Although the option to play a variety of starting puppets and see the story beats change nudges up the replayability factor, Shadows: Awakening does become repetitive. There are moments where characters feel unbalanced, and load times can border on egregious. Overall, though, Shadows: Awakening breaks the mold of the action RPG and reshapes it in some entertaining ways while still retaining enough of the genre to appeal to fans.",
"With its most obvious original appeal – 'real' Ass Creed on a handheld – gone, Liberation's appeal is diminished. While it does have some interesting ideas, which the main series itself would benefit from trying to integrate, this is the same old Creed, with the same old problems.",
"Rollerdrome combines the skate game feeling of satisfaction from landing the perfect trick, with the pulse-pounding adrenaline of fighting for your very life. Between the story that you must find for yourself and the varied arenas that throw new ways to move and do tricks, there’s never a dull moment to be found. Rollerdrome is by no means a long game, but it is one that is just so easy to pick up and play.",
"Saint Seiya Brave Soldiers has little to offer for those who do not like or even know the series written by Masami Kurumada. As ""Fighting game"" is to shallow to appeal to a broader public, but at the same time, it's like the piece that was missing from the experience fans had with Sanctuary Battle.",
"Bad controls, horrible voice-over (it's just as cliche as it was last time), and the trademark and annoyingly pervasive EA Radio will tax not only your brain, but also your ears. Soccer may be a beautiful game, but it's about time to kick FIFA Street 2 to the gutter.",
"The Thaumaturge is an unsettling RPG, offering a branching story set in a late 19th-century Warsaw from the perspective of a flawed, supernatural warrior. It is a dark and harrowing journey, fully committed to exploring the conflicting desires of the people in the city of Warsaw; there is little whimsy, less humor, and no distraction from this goal. This requires an equal commitment from the gamer to this flavour of the genre — there is no grinding, karaoke mini-games or creature-collecting distractions here: your prince is in another castle. The game narrative and combat systems build on these dark themes, cleverly framing them in how Wiktor uses his abilities as a thaumaturge. Even if the multiple story paths sometimes buckle under their ambitious weight, and combat can become a little too lacking in variety, this is a person, a city and a time worth visiting and learning from for those it ensnares. Just remember to bring pizza, a drink (or two), and turn the lights down low. Very low.",
"Although the game’s engine could be tweaked to run smoother and maybe it will in the future, a lot of the time the graphics aren’t what make a game. It’s the storyline and how much you are enjoying the experience are the real reason this game will score higher for me.",
"Features a surprisingly impressive presentation, complete with realistic physics and some of the most destructible environments ever seen in a game, which lead to some very exciting unscripted moments.",
"The new levels are a treat to play in with eye-popping visuals, the humor is as chuckle-worthy as ever and the increase in options when it comes to boulders and units to work with allows for deeper strategy and more insane skirmishes, be it against the AI or a friend.",
"If you already own Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on a console, the Vita version is going to be hard to recommend unless you are a super fan of the game and want to take that same experience on the go. For people who haven't touched the game and have just picked up a brand spanking new Vita, ask yourself this – are you looking for a console experience and/or a great fighting game to play? If so, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is highly recommended. Its move from home consoles to the handheld device is a near perfect one, and Capcom throws in extras for good measures. Let's get ready to fight!",
"With a larger focus on strategy and a handful of smaller new features, Samurai Warriors 4 Empires will certainly appeal to veteran fans of the series but it simply just hasn’t evolved enough to ensnare wayward players or newcomers to its overly well-worn brand of tactical combat.",
"Too many basic lessons on how to treat players go unlearnt. Even over its short duration, initially colourful scenarios become sadly static and tired. Journey of a Roach has some promising ideas, but unfortunately struggles to demonstrate them at their best.",
"You have to credit Evil Dead: Regeneration for almost living up to its name by breathing some new life back into an abysmal video-game franchise. Still, this regeneration is a far-cry from a revolution and must be content with being familiar, satisfying, and diminutive.",
"Need for Speed Unbound does not reinvent the wheel, but it does tune it. Criterion Games wanted to stand out with its new artistic style and has succeeded. We are not facing the best driving game of the year, but we do see an NFS that wants the saga to return to the highest categories. Fun, fast and furious.",
"Capcom clearly had a lot of fun designing this DLC, as even the title pokes fun at its tendencies and strategies throughout the years. While it's clear that the company has let more than a few of fans down over the years, every so often it has been known to surprise people, and this is one of those occasions.",
"Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive, Mini Motorways is now available on Steam for aspiring city planners. If you’re ready to tear your hair out of your follicles over the algorithm’s decision to construct a house 10 million miles away from its destination, it may very well become one of your favourite time-wasters.",
"With an immediate control system and a gameplay easy to master, Manticore – Galaxy On fire will satisfy and entertain fans of the genre looking for a shooter that's not too challenging.",
"It's a game that's just incredible fun, mixing in all sorts of gaming ideas with the thrill of the real sport, painting a final touch of extreme excess and color for scintillating effect. [Nov 2003, p.86]",
"Despite a few new skins and some extra tunes - sepia squares with fusion jazz, anyone? - this PS2 puzzler just doesn't have the mantrap bite of its smaller brother. [Mar 2007, p.121]",
"Phantasy Reverie Series is a great opportunity to play again (or discover for the first time) two cult platform games. Some elements feel outdated, even with the graphic improvements, but they are still fun to play.",
"As a Roguelike, Jupiter Hell stumbles with the randomness that shakes up each run instead, allowing the player a lot of control over how they want to build their character. Despite this, there is fun to be had with the tactical shooter.",
"Darksiders II is better than we expected, we just loved it. It offers tons of content to keep us playing for many many hours, and proves that you don't need to reinvent the wheel to create something new and full of personality. As a game it is excellent and generous with the player, so if you liked the first game, then you should now the wait was worth it. If you miss the original Darksiders, please give this a try. To sum up, it's just one of the adventures of the year. A must-have.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition marks the rebirth of a classic JRPG game. Featuring a deep and engaging story, a revamped audiovisual section, tons of enhancements that optimize the quality of the experience and update it, and a new epilogue focused on Melia, this new version is an essential masterpiece for any fan of the genre.",
"The tale is muddled and poorly executed, the action is unremarkable, and yet, for all its issues, Blade Kitten is still a playable game with enough sugary-sweet style to appeal to a younger audience – or indeed those with an interest in all things cat-girl.",
"Online play means that even solo players are able to go up against real opponents, but there aren't enough great mini-games in the collection to warrant more than one or two plays through what is on offer.",
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a charming and visually pleasing experience that will remind you immediately of 3D Legend of Zelda titles, mainly The Wind Waker, in how the towns, island, and citizens are portrayed.",
"Race On is one of the best simulation racers, but Simbin should take a good look at their series and perhaps breathe some new life in it. There’s little change here and the game could use the option to damage your cars.",
"Intriguing – despite a mounting pile of evidence showing that it should be terrible. The characters and story are so outlandish and bizarre that they are fascinating – but the nonsense and clunky mechanics never coalesce into a satisfying experience. It lures you in with the promise of something unique, then botches the execution.",
"Aside from the graphics, Diablo II hasn't really changed all that much since its debut in 2000, but Blizzard classic ARPG has aged gracefully and is still a deeply engaging and fun experience.",
"Namco Museum is a collection of arcade games from Bandai Namco's past. Even though some of the games are timeless, they don't seem to capture that same kind of magic like they would in an arcade hall. Because of that, Namco Museum falls short.",
"Overall, you can't really expect a whole lot from Kill Team in terms of diversity – at it's core, it's a hack and slash/twin stick shooter with slight RPG elements. While I had a lot of fun with it, one can only hope THQ will branch out, show us more of the grimdarkness of the 40K world, and fix a few technical snags along the way.",
"With spectacular action, great controls and a lot of emphasis on the story, Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is the best option for those who are looking to bring space battles anywhere on the Nintendo Switch.",
"Compulsion Games signs what is undoubtedly its magna opus with South of Midnight. A tremendous adventure in a fictional corner of the deep south of the United States that takes a multitude of influences to create a world as peculiar as it is attractive. Shocking visually, outstanding musically and with characters and interpretations more than up to par, the new Microsoft Studios manages to catch with an addictive and fluid gameplay that ends up shaping a rounded product and 100% recommendable.",
The Expanse: A Telltale Series is off to a great start with Episode 1. It offers all the important things that a fan of the show would need to feel at home if this is their first time playing a game from Telltale and it offers enough new mechanics to grab the interest of long-time Telltale fans.,
"Still, it's as good as it gets in terms of an arcade horse racing game, and it's impossible to deny its addictive qualities. It's just a shame that Tecmo took the series into this more solitary direction.",
"NBA 2K23 has it all. Its nostalgic ways massage the affection that more traditional NBA fans have for games and teams of the past, while also bringing a little bit of the history that turned the NBA into the emotional machine it is today. All of this combined with gameplay changes like improved spacing and better AI make this an ideal game for sports game fans. NBA 2K23 is indeed one of the best experiences for basketball fans in games, but please, stay away of its microtransactions. Particularly, we focus on the parts without it and that's the path for some real fun.",
"Ronin took some risks, trying to mix two very different genres, and combining them in what ends up being a stiff, repetitive yet short game. The concept is intriguing. The execution, not so much.",
"In the end, I found Dead Island: Riptide to be a fun stopgap in the series, despite not being a full-fledged sequel. Certain things could have been better, like the characters, story, and more innovation. There are a couple of new skills, a new character, and new locations, but it's not wildly different. The initial location is nearly identical to the starting island area from the original game, and while it might feature a different layout, it's really hard to initially tell them apart.",
"Although the game works as a fresh take on the familiar without adding too much new content to leave old fans feeling lost, it also doesn't do as much as it could to liven things up.",
"Holding back choices from the player does nothing but destroy a game's accessibility, and this is a token case. In the end, what we have with Yars' Revenge is a game with a genuinely novel and interesting aesthetic, but the lack of control concessions makes it something that's not worth picking up - that is, without trying the demo and making sure they're absolutely comfortable with how the game controls. Odds are that they won't be.",
"You will love EA Sports FC 25 and hate it at the same time – just like every previous installment. Nevertheless, the FC IQ system makes me feel, for the first time in a while in this series, the big potential for customizing tactics and individual player roles.",
"For Homestar fans, this is a no-brainer, but if they’re the only ones who play it, it’ll be a shame — the only thing you need to enjoy it is a sense of humor. It’s a great beginning to a longer adventure, and absolutely worth a download.",
"Puzzle games have always been on the boring side to me. Most puzzle games follow a certain standard. Crush starts its own standard, and I have a hunch that many games will try and replicate it.",
Despite the complaints that I mentioned above if you are a fan of Alan Wake then you should really play this game. It is a beautiful looking title and Remedy has raised the bar for XBLA games going forward. You really should play the original first though so that you can properly grasp what is going on and what Alan is fighting against.,
"Hotline Miami is a gift for those who are willing to enjoy the old-arcade essence of the 8 and 16 bits era. Furthermore, the gameplay mechanics are superb and the strong 80ish atmosphere adds to a really twisted travel.",
"Un-inspiring characters fighting un-inspired battles to get to un-inspired cutscenes just makes for a boring, tedious disc. If you hate RPGs there will be nothing in this game to change your mind.",
"Assassin's Creed Unity: Dead Kings surprised us as a solid and rich in content DLC, offering new challenge, a new and destructive weapon and numerous side quests that engage players for 6 to 8 hours: a good amount of time for what is a free DLC.",
"Once you get the upgrades rolling and start getting farther with each new attempt, boredom gradually sets it as you realize: story-centric spacesims are better. They have a clear endgoal and missions that give a sense of accomplishment. Sure, Everspace does have a (barebones) story, sometimes you even get a sidemission, but its main motivation – get to the last sector just because – does not motivate enough. [Issue#221, p.88]",
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Tape 1 is an intriguing introduction to a mysterious new world. With its characters and setting at the forefront, this rose-tinted view of the mid-90s is welcoming, nostalgic, and perfectly blends this tale’s more enigmatic side. It is incredibly slow at times and it doesn’t answer an awful lot, but truth be told, we’re dying to have those questions addressed in the latter part of the story. Tape 1 has teed it up, so it’s down to Tape 2 to secure the home run.",
"Fans of the franchise should pick this up, if they’re eager to see what Kingdom Hearts III will have in store, although newcomers would do better to pick one of the previous HD remakes.",
"The game is one of the better Westerns we’ve seen on a video game console, and while that’s not saying a whole hell of a lot when you put it into context, it should be taken as faint praise.",
"For hardcore baseball simulation fans, I have no problem recommending MLB Power Pros 2008 – but for families looking for an extension of Nintendo’s incredible Wii Sports, I would recommend looking towards titles like Little League World Series 2008 or Mario Super Sluggers that fully embrace the Wii’s model and functionality.",
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a fun look Pac in time to an era where 3D platformers were far more prominent than they are today. While it doesn’t quite outclass some of its contemporaries like Crash Bandicoot Warped and Super Mario 64, Pac-Man World isn’t one to miss if you’re looking for another solid 3D platforming adventure. Depending on how you view the new difficulty balances (or if you just really love Ms. Pac-Man) this is undoubtedly the best way to experience the PS1 classic.",
"A combination of a streamlined length that doesn’t overstay its welcome, terrific level design, fluid controls and an overall aesthetic that’s both charming and well-integrated, Tinykin is a joy to play and an easy recommendation for any fan of 3D platformers.",
"Dark Sector goes for gore and glory, but does better spattering blood than it does applying polish. Despite a number of original elements and a fairly solid gameplay core, the game isn’t able to add substantially to the formula and mechanics it’s borrowed from other games in the genre.",
"There may not be more cars than can ever be theoretically driven to make it the Xbox's Gran Turismo, and it's not the deepest racing game, so Bizarre Creations won't be quaking in their boots in fear for the safety of their spectacular Xbox 360 sequel, Project Gotham Racing 3, but Forza Motorsport is an essential racing sim for Xbox gamers everywhere.",
"Overall and while we focus on the positive aspects of the game we can see some really encouraging premises built up for a forthcoming major RE title, even though there is some evident lack of identity and some design choices that don’t do justice to the rest of the work that’s been put to the game. Still, Capcom delivered the first almost satisfying RE title in years.",
"It is fun. A hell of a lot of fun, actually. But the inverse is, unfortunately, true when your team isn’t work together, or you’re being dominated by an opposing team that has its shit together.",
"It has non-stop action, fresh gameplay, varied environments, an engrossing storyline, multiplayer that will have people busy for years to come, and some of the nastiest and coolest kills I’ve seen in a videogame.",
"If you love fanservice, and especially the kind that lets you exploit underage-looking anime girls feel free to add a couple of marks to that – if you’re everyone else then knock a couple off.",
"There are beautiful moments in After Us worth seeing, but they’re buried in poorly directed levels featuring merely adequate gameplay. There’s not enough to consistently grab onto here to really hook most players. After Us has a lot in common with Piccolo Studios’ last narrative platformer but ultimately doesn’t offer the charm or consistently moving story that made that game so memorable.",
"Limbo-like Monochroma has some stunning looking environments but is apart from that a quite hollow shell of a puzzle-platformer. The fate of the two protagonists could have been more involving, and the same could be said about the uninspired puzzles. Controls and ingame mechanics struggle as well and make the game hard to recommend to any but fans of the genre.",
"Arma III is the best representation of realistic warfare I've seen to date, and I for one can't wait to see what the community cooks up for it. For now, however, it is a bit too skinny for its breeches.",
"Soldier of Fortune III: Payback has a wonderful plot. The downside is the bugged single player, the terrible framerate, and the sometimes glitchy audio. The only great part about the game, is the timeless multiplayer which has so much to offer.",
"In a year of great releases, Ghost Song stands apart as one of the best. It was a fantastic adventure from start to finish. If you have played and enjoyed Metroid Dread and are looking for something to tie you over as you wait for Silk Song, Ghost Song will take you on a journey that will amaze and surprise you.",
"It’s quite sad that Chamber of Time so actively works against you in many ways. The tediousness of everything, from school exploration to combat, can really start to drag on you after a while, even if you do enjoy the story and characters.",
"If you&#146;re looking for a new racing game on your PS2 and only have $10, give Corvette a try, it won&#146;t disappoint you. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, and you will surely get what you pay for.",
"Need for Speed was seriously starting to look dead and buried – and here comes the rescue party! The combination of beautiful, realistic-looking graphics and effects borrowed straight from an anime works surprisingly well, the story doesn’t get in your way and the driving model hits exactly the right spot. Even the open world is fun! This is how you make an arcade racing game.",
"Close to the Sun deserves praise for the world it builds and just how gorgeously rendered that world is. There are moments of pure wonder throughout the campaign, but it doesn’t quite reach its full potential. Between an underdeveloped protagonist and a lack of meaningful collectibles, I was left wanting more. In the end, the problem is not that it flies too close to the sun, but rather it doesn’t fly close enough.",
"What Silent Storm does better than most strategy titles, even those not of the type, is create dynamic, diverse situations that players must adapt to using an insane number of weapons, skills, and evolving strategies.",
"The original ""Lumines"" is one of the standouts of the PSP's game library; however, like ""Lumines II,"" we're suspicious that Lumines Plus is simply a quick way to cash in. [Apr 2007, p.87]",
"But with charming characters, fun scripted events, and the chance to play with past and future versions of yourself, you can't help but have a great time with TimeSplitters: Future Perfect.",
"The best part of Game of Thrones is TellTale's abilities to stay true to HBO license. The game is bloody, gory and violent as the best episodes of the TV Show. But time has come to use a new gaming engine.",
"While the game boasts about 40 different Ducati motorcycles that span the length of the company's storied existence since World War II, Ducati World Racing Challenge is severely hampered by its poor control, obsolete graphics, and bad sound.",
"It's an example of master storytellers at the height of their powers, and despite the shadow of its illustrious heritage, Final Fantasy XII is by far and away the best game in the series yet.",
"It can be too repetitive at times and too easy for gamers looking for challenge. However, the spooky theme and familiar Disney settings will make Haunted Mansion an enjoyable diversion for many.",
"Much like the fauna that inhabits its world, Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a beautifully odd creature. The things it does well it does extremely well, which leaves me baffled at some of the obvious drawbacks that limit its scope and longevity. With that said, I am massively impressed by what such a small team was able to accomplish, and the attractive launch price certainly makes it all the more appealing.",
"A terrific program to keep around for dabbling purposes&#8212;load up a design, tinker with it, put it away for a while. More obsessive types will probably tweak their rides infinitely.",
"Overall, Valkyria Revolution does many things differently than Valkyria Chronicles and will be quite divisive. As a fan of Chronicles, I found that game to be better overall and yet the faster pace of Revolution makes this more fun to play – the story just doesn’t hold up as well and the graphics are less impressive here than Chronicles. The action RPG shift works at keeping things interesting on the battlefield at all times and keeps you on your toes too. It does suffer from some iffy textures, but the game is greater as a whole than the sum of its parts. It’s a fantastic gateway game for the franchise for newcomers and offers veterans a completely new gameplay experience in many ways while also keeping some elements similar enough to make for a smooth transition.",
"If you’ve ever wondered what the combination of an extreme sports title and a third-person shooter would be like, Rollerdrome is the game for you. Its story might be a let-down, and some gameplay elements might not hit the mark as well as they should do, but on the whole this is a thoroughly original and entertaining affair. We hope we get to spend more time with Kara in the future, too, as there’s a lot of scope here for further violent high-octane antics.",
"While Mini Motorways isn’t going to present you with an incredible story or massively varied mechanics, the experience is one you’ll want to keep coming back to. There are seemingly countless options to choose from, and the new Challenge City update takes it to the next level. If you are looking for a game that can be played for 5 minutes or 5 hours, Mini Motorways is absolutely worth every second of your time.",
"Naruto: Rise of Ninja is not the kind of title many gamers would pick up from the shelf and give it a look, because let's face it – those anime titles tend to be a bit rubbish unless you love the show. Thing is, this is a game that stands on its own as a worthy action-adventure or fighting game.",
"Ontamarama is certainly no Elite Beat Agents, but its style of gameplay is definitely unique. Perhaps it should have been called Multitasking Training in Japan in order to gain better sales.",
"Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time is probably a safe pick up for diehard fans, a gamble for those with a little bit of familiarity like myself, and a dangerous choice for anyone outside of those two categories. For a title based on a world filled with magic, the game itself has very little of it to be found.",
"Neon White is a stylish, unique title that’s sure to see a dedicated community of speed runners and action game fans alike flock to it. It’s like nothing I’ve played before, and I can’t stop thinking about its lucid but responsive gameplay even after playing for hours on end.",
"Need for Speed Unbound is a visually appealing game accessible to anyone. Hardcore fans are going to enjoy it a lot, and casual fans too. Thanks to this great work, Criterion has the window open to present new ideas like the one we saw in Unbound.",
Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition on the Nintendo Switch is a surprisingly pleasurable port of a rather hefty console game. Whether you're a dinosaur fan or not there is plenty of fun here for fans and newcomers to the sim genre. It would have been naive to not assume that the graphics would take some loss as compared to the more powerful competitor consoles. If you can live with that and the abundance of small text to be read then the tradeoffs are worth the portability.,
"Limited multiplayer options aside, Lumines Electronic Symphony blends puzzle, rhythm and visuals together in an almost euphoric way. What looks like a humble block-shifting affair at first glance is actually one of the best titles in the PS Vita's launch lineup. Throw in one of the best soundtracks you're ever likely to hear and we have an excellent purchase on our hands.",
"Although based on a neat idea, this movie tie-in is hampered by a severe lack of content. A broken battle system and some extremely tedious gathering of items make How to Train Your Dragon hard to recommend to anyone.",
"Criminal Girls: Invite Only is most likely a title that will be condemned for its slightly misogynistic undertones, but in truth it should be denounced for its shoddy game play, bland characters and unambitious level designs.",
"Developed by Krillbite Studios and an indirect sequel of their previous game The Plan, Sunlight brings an exciting perspective on walking simulators. Far from replicating the environments in their past work such as the terrorizing atmosphere in Among The Sleep or the dreadful cities in Mosaic, this relaxing narrative adventure displays a more natural aesthetic, with both the auditive and visual aspects in it being genuinely delightful.",
"It oozes character from every pore, yet bends rather than breaks the steadfast conventions of the FPS. For this reason, a partiality towards the Dredd franchise is not just a recommendation, but a practical requirement when playing the game.",
"If you are willing to accept technical shortcomings, mainly in certain menus and at ground level, as well as a clearly impoverished aesthetic on Nintendo Switch, you will have, with Jurassic World Evolution - Complete Edition, a solid edition, with intuitive handling. and more than solid lifespan. While docked mode is to be avoided, nomadic mode offers better performance, not always stunning, but stable enough not to spoil the experience.",
"All of this amusement with words is priced at a smashing 400 Microsoft Points, a bargain when there has been a noticeable increase of prices recently on XBLA. It's quite hard not to recommend the title, and I can only see people who really loathe games that require a good use of vocabulary hating it. For everyone else, this gaming dictionary is worth your time and you might even learn a few new words during your play – who says learning can't be fun?",
"Jurassic World Complete Edition is a technical marvel on Switch. Delivering everything in a single package, this version of the game carries with it all three expansion packs, and all of the optional dino packs, making it the most complete version to date. While the undocked version is slightly lower fidelity, it’s a small concession for being able to build your own ill-advised dino park on the go.",
"There's no doubt that this game is a great investment for any casual poker player looking to push their game to the next level, and it's certainly one of the very best poker titles available for your PC.",
"Children deserve massive, explorable worlds just as much as adults. It’s wonderful that TT Fusion took that concept and made a fully functioning and largely non-violent world without sacrificing action. You won’t miss firing guns or swinging lightsabers in Lego City — not when you’re scouring the landscape for super builds and smashing everything in sight.",
"We all know that war is hell, but this game often forgets that games need to be entertaining. At times the missions are just too frustratingly difficult, with your soldiers facing near-impossible odds.",
"Taking the best of Left 4 Dead and Chivalry: Medieval Combat and improving upon it, Warhammer End Times - Vermintide is a very good game that offers hours of great co-op multiplayer survival experience.",
The episodic concept worked well already in Crimes & Punishments and serves its purpose here as well. Even with the low difficulty level spending the time with the sleuth was worthwhile.,
"In short, this game is entirely underwhelming. The storyline tries to be interesting, but just appears a muddled mess of stereotypes; the characters themselves look alright, but set pieces are empty and boring and littered with invisible walls pointing in only a few directions for exploration; and the battle system isn’t much for “battling” at all, even against the “tough” boss characters.",
"Sorry Saint Seiya, but your old fashioned drawing style, super cliché dialogues and bad storytelling won't convince us. Neither will a few hours of 'entertainment', a simplistic combat system and repetitive nature. Too bad, because there's something about the simple Japanese storytelling that speaks to us, like Pokémon and Dragonball Z do.",
"For fans of fires or fans of just wasting away time staring into a dark monitor, EFR will be your ""Game of the Year"". For other video gamers with at least a half-mind, look elsewhere for your fire controlling needs.",
"Anybody who was a major fan of the original Sin should pick this up unquestionably, as while the lack of the usable computer terminals (another beef of mine) is disappointing, everything else that made the original Sin feel like a cool and unique title for it’s time is still present in Emergence.",
"Quantity over quality has never been exhibited so perfectly as it is here. Having 150 games is undoubtedly impressive, but when the vast majority of them are barely decipherable, let alone playable, you’re probably only really left with around 15 titles that will hold your attention for more than a minute. While the contribution these games made to the evolution of gaming in its early days can’t be denied, many of them are stepping stones that we don’t need to walk over again.",
"Kick & Fennick is the kind of game that I was ready to put down about a chapter before things wrapped up. It’s not a bad game, I’m mostly positive on it, but it took too long to capture my attention.",
"While the combat is entertaining and the dungeon crawling is okay, the story and the whole idea of having to “motivate” these girls are simply too unnecessary, too uncomfortable, and too offensive for this game to be worth your time.",
"Rollerdrome certainly has its issues, but the overwhelmingly chaotic action is fun enough to compensate. I continually found myself dropping back into levels to try and chase higher scores and take out my foes with increasing style. There are elements that could have been fleshed out further, but considering the scope of the project, I'm impressed with the results.",
"Short but sweet, Spilled! is a solo project that sees you cleaning up oil spills and litter from a series of waterways. You'll have it completed in roughly an hour, but it's very much an hour well spent, especially if you love relaxing clean-up games.",
"Sine Mora’s doctrine of sincerity, authority, and respect aligns neatly with shoot ’em up’s interest in unconscious obliteration and strategic composure. EX brings welcomed extensions to Sine Mora, but a clean transfer to modern hardware is a prudent enough motive to justify a re-release. The oldest genre in gaming always has something new to learn.",
"Driver has escaped near-death with a captivating and colourful return, and one where everything from systems to cinematics is of a quality build. As surprises go, it’s a juggernaut. [Apr 2006, p.84]",
"An intriguing premise - that of a soulslike science fiction in which you fight mostly at a distance, using upgradable grenades and guns - turned into one of the worst video games of recent years: a sloppy title, poorly conceived and in some areas clearly ""broken"".",
"South of Midnight represents everything gaming is about. Gaming at its core is a true amalgamation of all major art-forms. Music, visuals, story, art-style. The ability to take all of those and make something that stands out is no easy feat. South of Midnight not only accomplishes it, it excels at it. Compulsion poured their hearts into making something they were truly passionate about. You feel it every second of it you play.",
"Knowledge is Power is more than just another trivia game, it's a battle of wits and reflexes. The goofy characters and the ridiculous hazards will cause everyone to burst out laughing. Once you start a game, it might not be long before you realize you've played another five.",
"The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask for the New Nintendo 3DS is a great remake, with many interesting changes from the original formula. Most of the new features work in a great way, offering a smooth and lovely gaming experience. Zora’s new swimming system is a little bit disappointing, clumsy and less fun than the original one. Both new players and fans of the original Nintendo 64 game should give this new Majora’s Mask the right amount of love.",
"Arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones, but the game still suffers from clunky interface and lackluster AI. For an Arma fan like myself, though, it is the best Arma so far. [Oct 2013]",
"Even with its replayability and late-game problems, Silent Storm is really the best turn-based tactical game ever. Yes, it doesn&#146;t have the strategic aspects of X-Com, but no game has such advanced combat.",
"Urban Trial Playground may be not as deep or demanding as its model, but it offers enough challenges to have a good time playing it, as long as you can pass on its poor visuals and level-design.",
"The hype machine put a lot on the shoulders of Resistance: Burning Skies and the initial multiplayer snags didn't help matters. Still, I have enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the series will too.",
"So to be clear… there is a lot of fun to be had here. The actual action of the game is great fun, but for me it’s not worth the bother of dealing with the menus and the “glitch” style. If you are desperate to get back into the Superhot world then you may well enjoy the fact that you can play over and over again, otherwise it’s a pretty steep price tag for something that for some people feels like a fight just to get to the fighting in game.",
"F1 2013 is a great game – the best of the series thus far, in fact. For racing fans without last year's game, its acquisition is a no-brainer. However, those with F1 2012 are encouraged to try before buying. There are few changes on last year's formula and Classic Mode's potential vastly outweighs its offering this time around.",
"Rock Band 3 have an amazing track list, an exciting new support for instruments and many challenges and rewards that will keep us busy for months. This is the best iteration in any musical saga to date. A must-have.",
"In the end, your enjoyment of Close to the Sun will depend on whether you want to be surprised. If you've played some of the previously mentioned games, you know exactly what to expect in terms of pacing and story, even if the subject matter is different. The lack of combat is an interesting choice, but the simple puzzles and slightly frustrating chase sequences dull the experience, while the inability to view collectibles after you leave a level significantly diminishes their value.",
"Its story unfolds at a good pace and looks great on the Vita. There's only one thing missing: the skies were never burning! Maybe a bit dark in places, but never burning. At some point I could have used a burning sky to lighten up the game.",
"To level, to learn and to master a character and reach the ultimate goal in Guardian Heroes is just as fun today as it was during the Saturn era. If not better. The graphics have been polished and this is a smooth retro trip down memory lane that no true gamer ever should miss.",
Complementing the on-field awesomeness is Year Two of online franchise mode. It’s better than before — you can even manage it from EA’s website or from your iPhone — and we encountered no issues during our testing.,
"Calling a title “the best game of 2024” may come across as rather shortsighted when done so in February. I don’t care. I’m going to say it. I believe Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the best game we are going to see in 2024, and it also gives me faith in the future of the series.",
"The Thaumaturge successfully delivers a weird and surprising RPG that is filled to the brim with narrative. Whether you’re chasing down demons, or manipulating the minds of the socially elite, you’ll feel the power of the Thaumaturge. With its complex turn-based combat and choice consequence system, there are plenty of opportunities for replayability.",
"Even though this compilation doesn't have the same amount of content that past remastered Kingdom Hearts packages, it's exciting to see a little bit of the future of the series on the actual generation of consoles with a great remaster of a portable game and a short game that showed us the evolution of the franchise.",
"If you’ve got any doubts about visual novels in general, Root Double isn’t the best starting point on Switch. The structure is going to be intimidating at first, and the environment is as oppressive as the design suggests. But if you’ve gone and turned a Switch Lite into a visual novel reader, Root Double will keep you up late at night trying to get to that next ending.",
"Tinykins as the name suggests, are not only the tiniest, but also the cutest of useful helpers who will assist the scientist Milodane on his wholesome journey across this typical, insects infested human household. This staple of relaxing game marries addictive gameplay and creative game mechanics with adorable visuals and peaceful soundtrack. This must play hidden gem draws a lot of inspiration from the infamous Pikmin series, but it does this just as gracefully as Milo slides across the many rooms on his dope soapsurf.",
"ROTK13 lacks any of the basic macro and combat strategy fundamentals of previous titles, making this a sequel in name only. If you liked Sphere of Influence then you’ll enjoy this title too. But for those who waited for an ROTK game, keep waiting.",
"Through its action-oriented gameplay, Bloodline Champions is very demanding in terms of time and experience since every character plays differently and you have to learn exactly how in order to win a match.",
"At around five-plus hours of fun, Hell Yeah! doesn't outstay its welcome. From that first negative reaction to the title, we never expected to be saying this: Hell Yeah! is a fast, smooth and intelligently designed platformer with boundless enthusiasm, a winning imagination and stellar production values.",
"I left Röki on my backlog for far too long; don’t make the same mistake I did — play Röki sooner rather than later. A story of loss, love, trauma, and sacrifice told through the beautiful folklore of Scandinavian cultures and the lens of a heroic little girl, Röki will feel like an entirely new experience and is a welcome addition to the point and click genre. Don’t let the forest take another victim — grab Röki and save your family before it’s too late.",
"Undoubtedly a very high-quality turn- based strategy. The remarkable combination of Heroes, Civilization (4X) and Total War brings a large number of options that you can use on different maps, it's just a shame that without a full-fledged story. At first it might seems to be complicated and a little messy, but you'll get the hang of it quickly.",
"At its core, Forza Horizon 5 is about having fun behind the wheel. It’s technically excellent and plays brilliantly, but it never takes itself too seriously. I mean, I jumped a pinata float off a mountain at one point. That balance makes the Horizon series the most grin-inducing racing games out there, and arguably one of the largest feathers in Xbox Game Studios’ cap.",
"Mario Party 5 isn't badly made or put together, but it also doesn't offer all that much that hasn't been seen before, and certainly it isn't a game for you if you don't have a ready supply of other human players on hand.",
"Given the medium, that this is about as good as an FPS can be done on the PSP. (Aside from the retarded Tachikoma, and the ugly versions of the characters.) Which is to say, that nobody should ever, EVER make another FPS on the PSP. This game is proof of why it will never work.",
"Seriously, with more varied and visually stunning backgrounds, more detailed ship models, more interesting bosses, a better soundtrack, and better power-ups, Xyanide could have been a great shooter. While the negatives outweigh the positives, it is only $19.99, controls very well, and has an interesting story.",
Stronghold Crusader II is a great RTS game with a solid combat system and robust micromanagement. We love the freedom that we have to create our dreamed bastion and its addictive multiplayer options.,
A game that will entertain almost everyone looking for a simplistic fun platformer. If you're looking for a game that is epic and will last forever Astro Boy isn't it. [JPN Import],
"There are more than enough game variants here to keep you happy, playable in a convoy of fully customisable off-road vehicles and across some really detailed and expansive terrain. Check it out, it's the ultimate backseat drive.",
"The first season of Life is Strange is an experience between Quantic Dream productions and Telltale games. Something like a third lane, that becomes only darker and deeper with time. We're looking forward to see what Dontnod can make with the rewind in a second season.",
"Online play holds up admirably to the lobby features and netcode standards of the original, and dedicated pad players should find little trouble adjusting their links, loops, and launchers to the Vita's crisp controls.",
"The Nintendo Labo Variety Kit is a great interactive model/science kit to put together with your kids. If you like building or tinkering with stuff, you'll like this. If that's not your thing, you might find it tedious. Not a ton of replay value, but the construction seems sturdy. Overall, a very unique new 'game' for the Nintendo Switch.",
"The levels look pretty at first, but quickly become nauseating and boring when the same backgrounds continuously scroll by awkwardly. The gameplay itself is solid with intense, difficult combat, intriguing weapons, and huge battles.",
"It is a work of staggering genius, delicate like a snowflake, yet rugged like a prizefighter's face. SSX3 doesn't just demand your attention, but commands it, turning heads like a Hollywood celeb mozeying through Rochester Tesco's.",
"Neon White's story might revolve around a bunch of dead people in the afterlife, but when its magic is upon us it's hard to recall a game that has made us feel quite so alive. [Issue#374, p.106]",
"Despite the fact that Krome Studios was able to translate the story, look, and feel of the film well enough into its offering, the gameplay is simply too lifeless and frustrating to hold your attention the entire way through.",
"While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with Sword of the Stars: The Pit, there just isn't anything that is really mind-blowing. It is a well-polished roguelike that doesn't stray far from expectations, but instead stays in a rather comfortable zone from a game design perspective.",
"The Thaumaturge, with its unique setting that combines Slavic folklore with a largely unexplored time in world history, is a title that oozes character. It's certainly not without its flaws, but as far as AA titles go this one is as solid as they come.",
"Namco Museum is a nice way to bring so classic arcade titles to the Switch, but they’re mostly not anything we haven’t seen on past platforms. Playing some classics like Pac-Man, Galaga ’88, and Rolling Thunder on the go is a nice touch and is probably one of the main reasons to get this version of the game. However, with only eleven games (ten not counting Pac-Man Vs.), and a few of those are pretty much staples for Namco collections, a few more additions would have been nice to see, especially games we rarely get on compilations.",
"Concord has a solid foundation and interesting ideas; however, its bland cast of characters and lack of innovation make it a generic and unappealing hero shooter destined to fail, especially considering its $40 USD price tag. It's not a bad game, but is something much worse: an unnecessary product that fails to understand the market it competes in. Simply put, there are better and more enjoyable free alternatives out there",
"Completing the compulsory mini-games may be uncomfortable for some players, but Criminal Girls: Invite Only is very much a competent game and deserves a look, especially if you've all but converted your Vita at this point into a waifu-collection machine.",
"More problematic is the game's land-based combat. While I understand the difficulty in creating a decent sword-fighting system, the, Tortuga is button-mashing at its worst -- and not even multiple buttons!",
"Whether played with DLC or not, The Pit is one of the more solid roguelike titles on Steam, especially in a relatively flooded market. It is challenging but generally fair and allows the player a lot of choices in character development while providing a good atmosphere for dungeon delving. While its graphics and sound may not impress, The Pit's gameplay will keep players unafraid of long streaks of failure and ensure they come back to challenge it ""just one more time.""",
"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth improves on nearly every aspect of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, pushing the PlayStation 5 to the limit and creating a jaw-dropping experience in the process. Improving on both the Remake and the original version of the game seemed like a nigh impossible task, but somehow, Square Enix was able to do just that.",
"Batman’s third episode from season two does enough to keep the overall story ticking over, but a crowded narrative and confusing relationships mean this is the low point so far. Episode four will have to do much better.",
"The Japanese RPG may have suffered heavy blows at the hands of Western RPGs such as Skyrim and Fable, but The Last Story does much to demonstrate there's still life and innovation in the form. That this game should come from one of the genre's progenitors is testament to a creative spark that still fires even after all these years.",
"Fallen Legion‘s combat is fast without being overwhelming, and the timed choices added an emotional depth to the decisions I made. While I wanted control over the story in places where I didn’t have any and I wasn’t quite sold on some of the twists, that’s only because I was so fond of the character — it’s more a weakness of overambition than an actual failure. I enjoyed my time in Fenumia, and would enjoy some more.",
"A judge is what this Castlevania really needs. This franchise first time on Wii is a time-waster for anybody who wants to expend a nice afternoon playing with some friends. Not even its graphics are what they should be. Its a very poor game on every aspect except for its decent sound, but nothing more than that.",
"If Pulse had a longer, more in-depth story with evolving gameplay, it would be easily recommendable. As it stands now, it feels more like a proof-of-concept than a full-fledged game.",
"If you like the over-the-top, extreme nature of this series (and it's not for everyone; the pocket-protector variant of the fighting fan will probably not like it as much as the rest of us), you are going to love every ultra intense moment.",
"Fuel Overdose is enjoyable in small chunks, but chronic camera issues let it down. The title simply tries to do too much, and it lacks focus as result. With a little more refinement, this could have been an original and compelling release – but in its current guise, it feels like a missed opportunity instead.",
"World of Final Fantasy Maxima remains a rather fantastic game. Despite the story not being much to shout about, there is so much to like about the journey. The interactions between characters as well as the gameplay are incredibly well crafted. Maxima's presentation is halfway there between the higher-end versions and the PS Vita release. The textures aren't as flat as on Vita, but there is some blurriness to be seen. Overall though, this is one of the better full-blown RPGs on the system, with a no-nonsense approach that kept me coming back.",
"Paleo Pines is a slow burn, and the game holds itself slightly back with characters that don’t have to keep you engaged…Still, players who enjoy relaxed farming sims and dinosaurs will gradually want to discover and create a harmonious environment alongside these beings.",
Those Who Remain is a puzzle game disguised as a survival horror. It fails to deliver a memorable and thrilling game experience and is based on an old game structure with very few interesting moments.,
"Infernally fast vehicles racing and blowing each other up on numerous, well-designed tracks where distinction between floor and ceiling is often purely formal. If you still remember Rollcage fondly, you will probably turn a blind eye to average visuals, annoying music and some AI problems to simply enjoy the sensation of speed. [01/2019, p.79]",
"Fractured Mask is a well-written and engaging episode that restored our trust in Batman: The Enemy Within series. For the first time in a long while for a Telltale's game, we are very interested in the possible outcome that awaits Bruce and the other main characters in the next episode.",
"Those who’ve been playing the recent releases will find NBA 2K23 more of an update to the previous version rather than a completely new iteration of a popular franchise. And they wouldn’t be wrong. 2K has tried to polish the best parts of the game, while also reducing the focus on the ones that don’t seem to be praised as much as others. Eventually, NBA 2K23 is a game that will still keep you entertained for some time, though the lack of a more massive overhaul will probably upset way too many fans of the franchise.",
"While many may still argue they’ve taken a too glossy approach to Tiberium Wars, it cannot be denied that it offers at its heart a lot of the core elements that made Command & Conquer the great universe it is.",
"If you don't mind a quite challenging learning curve, Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII is a great option for those who want to enjoy this genre on consoles. There aren't too many additions, but the game is very solid and engaging.",
"NBA 2K23 makes some worthy adjustments to gameplay, making this more entertaining without losing the game's fundamental presentation and feel. At the same time, even the map shrink in The City isn't enough of an addition to make 2K23 worth a must-buy status. Not enough of the game changes to merit a purchase this year, unless you maxed out everything in last year's release and want a fresh start. NBA 2K23 is more for die-hard fans than every before.",
"This game simply serves as a letter to fans with enough of a stockpile of guilty pleasure moments stacked up throughout that any true fan must buy this game, sadly everything is lost on anyone that hasn't devoted serious time to at least several of the titles this game borrows characters from.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is the pinnacle of the Playground Games series and is the new king of open world courses. To oust such a noble predecessor was not easy but the Leamington boys have further embellished the playful recipe and made the progression in Horizon Adventure clearer. In addition to the splendid expeditions around Mexico, the arrival of 360-degree editors such as Event Lab will allow the community to create wonders and expand a basic offer with few equals, both in terms of quantity and quality. Hypercars of all brands are even more enjoyable to drive and the audiovisual presentation goes to great lengths to strive for the full next-gen. While waiting to know what the future holds for us as a flagship team of the Xbox family, we can finally enjoy this monumental experience.",
"When it comes to the fight the game remains as clueless as before. An attack resembles a mob hit on the madhouse watchman's post: confused fighters run toward the target and drop dead on the way. All three formations are designed to provide a semblance of order, but after right click on the enemy such order immediately thrown into chaos. And, just as before, two dozen archers on the wall solve most of the issues of defense. The visual part of the game just aggravates the impression that ... Oops, there is no impression actually. Nobody creates games in this way anymore. [Nov 2014, p.99]",
"If Call of Juarez skipped its forgettable multiplayer and adopted a sandbox world more like Oblivion with fleshed out areas to explore and side missions, it could have been the gunslinger I’ve been waiting for all these years. As it stands, it’s a respectable if unambitious title that should tide over Western fans until the holy grail of six shooters rides into town.",
"There's just not enough here to warrant even a $15 price. The game includes only eight fighters in two divisions, and no real career mode to encourage long-term play. With more fighters and more easily unlocked bonus video content, the game would've offered a better introduction to this relatively new fighting league.",
"The clips provide great primers for how you should approach many of your starting hands, and for that reason alone, World Class Poker can be a valuable learning tool. [Dec 2005, p.96]",
"Even though the platforming doesn’t feel quite right and the puzzles are a little too simple, Pikuniku’s vibrant, whimsical aesthetic gives the game a charming sense of playfulness that almost completely mitigates these issues. When you’re running around with these colourful characters, watering flowers as a jaunty tune plays in the background, you don’t care that the jumping feels a little floaty or that the solution to the next puzzle is so obviously signposted. Pikuniku is the perfect remedy for a stressful day – check it out if you’re looking for something simple, colourful and genuinely funny.",
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue isn't impressive in terms of content when compared to others sets but it's a good example of a 3DS game ported to a big console. It will please the fans; everyone else should steer clear - casual gamers won't understand the phenomenon of this Disney/Final Fantasy hybrid.,
"If you're a fighting game enthusiast who enjoyed the console version Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and have dreamed about being able to take it anywhere, this game is a dream come true.",
"It isn’t perfect, but it takes everything that was great about its predecessor and makes the whole package more accessible. It’s a shining example of how to use shooter mechanics to tell a story, which is enough to make it a must-play in my book.",
"Visually amazing, intense and beautifully fast, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an amazing game that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, the campaign of this action-packed hack 'n slash is too short.",
"Lacks polish with lack of collision detection being the most obvious flaw, but Tour De France 2014 has hidden strategic depths that may appeal to fans of the world's most prestigious cycling race.",
"Regardless of how the series pans out, as a stand-alone title .hack//G.U. Vol.1//Rebirth is a fun title to play, especially if you're stuck with a PS2 while everyone else spends big money on the next-gen consoles.",
"Oil Rush could have been an all graphics, no gameplay showcase for Unigine, but somehow they have managed to make a neat looking and refreshing RTS that makes for a great evening in front of the computer.",
"Jupiter Hell is made for people who might not normally enjoy roguelikes or for people who have played the modern take on the genre and want a game that goes back to the old school rulebook, but brings with it some looter shooter, straight to the point, action.",
"Wattam combines an original concept with a simple but iconic design; software limitations, however, are some technical issue of the software and repetitiveness, also caused by the almost nonexistent challenge.",
"Without the pro instruments Rock Band 3 is a strong rhythm game but nothing extraordinary. With Pro Mode, and the new Pro instruments this game is a shining light in a genre that had become happy with mediocrity.",
"Decent physics, clever AI, online racing: this is everything GT4 should have been and wasn't, and it's allowed Forza to take the GT trophy away from Polyphony, at least for the time being. Buy it.",
"It has memorable characters that certainly could have made it a standout hit for gamers, but it seems the developers didn’t put enough time into fixing all the faults that included problems with camera angles, controls and more.",
"Crackpot Entertainment has created a decent action/detective game with some sharp graphics and a charming story. Sadly, Insecticide is not much fun to play with such wonky controls and buggy camera mechanics, and it may seem to drag at a snail's pace in some spots.",
"Both a fun experience for fans of the series as well as a good introduction for others. While the gameplay is a bit repetitive, it is still enjoyable, and both the visuals and audio make it a joy to experience.",
"While the potential for what one could do in the video game world of Constantine was unlimited, it is ultimately not realized due to the fact that action is the same throughout the whole game and is only carried by adding a slightly different objective for each stage.",
"Since aiming and movement is too difficult to track enemies as they appear, a typical mission will have you die on the first enemy, learn his location and kill him before he can strike back, only to be felled by a second enemy, and so on.",
"Though The Sexy Brutale fumbles a few times -- especially near the end when it rushes toward a narrative payoff -- it never hurts the experience. Uncovering the mansion's secrets and the twisted plot that dooms its guests is exciting. Compared to almost any other puzzle game, The Sexy Brutale's dark tone and inspired art stand out from the crowd. Solving murder might not be the most cheerful work, but it's one hell of a good time.",
"With lofty ambitions and some great elements, After Us lets itself down in as many ways as it triumphs. Gorgeous art direction and an admirable anti-pollution message aren't enough to make up for tedious combat, performance issues, and open-ended level design that plays things a little too loose. If you're itching for an experience like this, there are better options out there, at the very least until After Us' performance issues are addressed. There's the core of an incredible experience here, but it's just not ready yet.",
"Khazan had its hooks in me so deep that I kept throwing myself at the game, pushing myself to get better. When playing most of the games in this genre, I would just grind until I was powerful enough to overcome the boss fights. Not this time. I had to get better. I had to win. And there is no better feeling than conquering that mountain.",
"Hotline Miami is a prime example of how awesome indie game can be. It's creative, it's free spirited and it's cool as hell. This really is a must to buy for fans of highly original games.",
"But a New York City-sized upgrade to the visual presentation along with the inclusion of mini-games and more focused, goal-oriented gameplay should appeal to the urban-centric Sims fans that prefer console action to the PC.",
Lost Records: Bloom & Rage - Tape 1 is a fun nostalgic trip back to the '90s and the mechanic of making short clips on Swann's camcorder is a clever gameplay element that adds another welcoming layer to the mostly narrative experience.,
"It’s fairly obvious that a major reason for Samorost 3’s existence is to give its series some recognition as something other than a footnote to the rest of its developer’s work, and in that regard, it roundly succeeds. But after shaking off the “browser game” stigma, it merely continues its business as a temporarily enjoyable diversion.",
"Unfortunately, Omen of Sorrow feels like it’s taken a “quantity over quality” approach that results in a flaccid, broken experience. From the characters and art to the core act of fighting, nothing in Omen of Sorrow quite sticks the landing. There are a lot of incredible fighting games to check out this year, but Omen of Sorrow is not one of them.",
"And so Mario Party 5 continues the series&#146; yearly update without breaking the mould. A few extras here, a lick of paint there, a fresh repertoire of minigames and that&#146;s about it.",
"For fans, this is a dream come true and proof that Square Enix can still create a modern JRPG that, although based on the famous original, brings completely new content and realizes the vision of a true open-world Final Fantasy game. Although it's just the middle part of the Remake trilogy, Rebirth stands as a gigantic, massive JRPG with a huge world, an extra long and intricate story, and a ton of side content that should keep us entertained until the announcement of the final installment.",
"Fantastic music and unique scoring system aside, Iro Hero simply isn't a fun shoot 'em up. It definitely has potential but its tedious and often frustrating stages make it an easy shmup to pass on even if you're a huge fan of the genre.",
"Despite a couple odd inclusions, there was a lot of care given to making these experiences authentic, while at the same time giving players a lot of options that allow them to ruin that authenticity in favor of having a more enjoyable experience.",
"Even with just an additional pair of buttons for camera movement, a broad switch of irritations could have been avoided, but as it is, Death Jr is recommended only for forgiving platformer enthusiasts. [Nov 2005, p.113]",
"Even without any special incentives to replay through it once it's over, Final Fantasy XII offers a beautiful, well written, fun RPG experience that is both long and rewarding. Matsuno's team took some real chances with the gameplay this time around, but the results are pleasantly surprising. [Oct 2006, p.56]",
"It deepens in every aspect of Splatoon. The Addition of a coop mode, Salmon Run, the new levels in Hero mode and the original maps and weapons in online 4 v 4 battles complete a superb shooter. On the downside, we miss split screen multiplayer, more maps, and the voice chat system feels too complicated.",
"It's not the deepest strategy game ever made, but it does provide a few hours of lightweight strategic fun here and there, even if most of what it does has been done better elsewhere.",
"Technically there's nothing wrong with the game -- had it released in 2006. While it's great to have Visual Concepts back, they definitely left room for improvement for All-Pro Football 2K9, and improvement is certainly what's needed for this next generation of football games.",
"The clichéd storyline is accompanied by plenty of hammily acted cut-scenes, and the whole package is ultimately pretty forgettable. There's some nautical mileage in the sea battles, but that's not nearly enough.",
"The parts alone don't suggest a great game, but as a whole, it works really well, and I expect to be playing Starlancer for a while longer yet, especially with the incredibly fun cooperative mode available.",
"Metro: Last Light is a bold symphony to the senses. Deep Silver is the new bringer of AAA titles, now they have a lot to live up to. As the saying goes, you are only as good as your last game release. Deep Silver is now the one to watch.",
"The clearer focus on the campaign as well as the cool mythical troops and the setting are on spot, but total standstill in terms of battlefield mechanics and minor flaws make sure that Troy doesn’t reach its potential.",
"There’s a definite appeal in its cozy atmosphere and oddball characters, and the story about a community banding together to save what’s important to them is a heartfelt one. The minigames are a lot of fun, and what they lack in the precision you’d expect of a full-fledged arcade game, they make up for in sheer charm. But it’s also a game that leans a little too heavily into the quirky style of the “wholesome game” meme at the expense of substance and depth.",
"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Shadows: Awakening and hope that the developers eventually work on a sequel that irons out all of its issues. Until then, this is a mostly solid action RPG that's worth checking out.",
"The Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 01: Variety Kit is just what it says on the tin - one that serves up a variety of unique and interactive toys to build. Through a brilliant interface and robust card shapes, the kit offers hours of DIY building fun - with an interactive pay-off. The mini-games are somewhat short, leaning more towards concept pieces, but with the Labo Garage included, it creates limitless possibilities to explore and invoke a little mischief, too!",
"Need for Speed Unbound is a highly enjoyable and splendidly polished arcade racer. Criterion has picked meticulously through almost 30 years of NFS legacy, stitching together its finest elements to create a brilliant, feature-packed amalgamation that offers compelling gameplay, deep design, and dazzling aesthetics. Simply put, Need for Speed Unbound is one of the best entries in the history of the franchise.",
"Hard West 2 is a great game for skilled strategy fans. It has a mixture of familiar western elements and supernatural accents, an energetic narrative, and fun characters. While it’s a challenging game, Hard West 2 usually gives you the tools you need to succeed. You’ll need patience and determination, but then, life in the old west was hard.",
Gears of War 2 is a perfect example of blending game and art. An engrossing plot with emotion and battles on an absolute huge scale make this simply an experience that needs to be had by any gamer.,
"I got every joke in Mugen Souls, I just didn't find any of them terribly funny. Whether your tastes align more with the East or the West, poor game design is still poor game design.",
"Overall, Ridge Racer: Unbounded is a good arcade racing game, which offers many interesting features like its multiplayer modes, the track creator, the destruction of environments. But it could have been a better game, as it's unoriginal, all the cars are almost the same and its story isn't interesting. A good racing game that could have been a greater game.",
"Offers a lot of gameplay and a great addition to the XIII plot. Even though the graphics weren't revolutionary like XIII's and the slight pacing issue still remains, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is very good.",
"Hellbound is a classic shooter that works as a nice tribute that era, but falls short in many aspects. If you are looking for retro experience and you have already played the best ones, this can be a good option.",
"It mixes snazzy visuals with a good sense of speed, so there's little doubt hardcore Sonic fans will find a lot to like. Plus, it has a rewarding multiplayer mode and wager system, which only adds to the experience.",
"Hard West 2? More like 1.5 or perhaps an expansion with a new campaign and some improvements. It’s not a typical sequel or even a sequel at all. But maybe, if it works, there’s no point making changes?",
"The game is just so original and fun to play that you would be hard-pressed to not enjoy it. If you even remotely like games like Final Fight and Streets of Rage, then Guardian Heroes should be in your collection. Don't let this classic slip into obscurity for a second time.",
"It’s upbeat puzzle-platforming fun at its most deceptively chaotic, and while some aspects of it still feel stuck in the past, there’s also lots here to remind people of what made it so great in the first place.",
"It&#146;s been carefully crafted to provide superb gameplay, and especially great graphics, despite the fact that games of this nature can only ever really be used for boredom-busting.",
Brave Soldiers is a solid game for both the anime and the fighting game lovers. The combat system is easy to grasp and can be mastered even by less technical players. The interesting multiplayer modes and the huge fan service turn this product into something you can look after.,
"Topware Interactive has made a solid real-time strategy title with some interesting gameplay elements, but buyers should research a little and know what they are buying into before the final purchase.",
Legends of Eisenwald tries hard to challenge the competition. But as a roleplaying game it is either corny or boring while the turn based tactics are standard respectively borderline uninteresting.,
"A sort of misguided reworking of ""Homeworld,"" halfway between a rehash and a remodeling job, but with the intersting bits sanded off. The vividly distinct sides added in the ""Cataclysm"" expansion are gone, the clean interface is now a mess, and much of the strategy has been methodically cut out. [Dec 2003, p.126]",
"Deviations from past Final Fantasies may turn off some players, but this game is so classy, it’s like mouthwash for the nasty taste FFX/X-2 left in gamers’ mouths. It redeems a hallowed series which had begun to spiral into teeny-bopper, pop-idol-infested hell.",
"An intense and addictive adrenaline rush, a high-speed power fantasy that will make you feel like Jesus on Wheels - when it works. When it doesn't, which is a lot, races tend to reduce to exercises in tedium and frustration. [June 2012, p.73]",
"Troy is not a very good approximation of the actual Trojan War, nor is it pure mythological carnage. But, miraculously, it actually manages to blend real-time battles and long-term strategy into a really exciting cocktail.",
"Filthy Lucre strives to be a game of interesting choices between caution and gung-ho action. Unfortunately, the lack of challenge and inept AI mean that neither style of play is satisfying.",
"Sometimes, videogames are thought of as a means of escapism into worlds and universes you always wanted to immerse yourself and spend your time in, but in reality never could. I truly hope I never encounter someone who thinks this way about Hotline Miami.",
"The Last Story is an unfortunate disappointment. The battles are plagued by bad controls and a horrible camera, and the story suffers from unintentionally humorous dialogue. [March 2012]",
"It's unfortunate that the handwriting recognition portion of the touch-screen controls is largely broken (thank goodness it's optional!) and the presentation is as bland as can be, featuring only three generic background color choices and music tracks each, but even so, Sudoku Gridmaster offers a ton of content and just enough addictive gameplay to make any sudoku fan smile with glee.",
"Dead Island: Riptide is an unnecessary addition to the franchise and it has nothing to offer when compared to the first title of the series. Two years was a long time for a company like Techland to improve upon the experience of Dead Island, but nothing was done about it.",
"I despair! I despair before the vast amount of things that are simply wrong with this game: Graphics which range from prehistoric to reasonably acceptable, a continuously horrible soundtrack and features that just won’t work properly. For my sanity’s sake, give me a proper movie game, just once!",
Without a doubt this is the most complete Formula One package from Codemasters yet. But nonetheless it feels like the team in Birmingham doesn’t do anything more than what is absolutely necessary to justify a new game.,
"Parallel Lines is a stylish game; everything from the cut-scenes and dialogue to the excellent soundtrack has been constructed meticulously to produce an almost Tarantino simulacrum of 1970s Americana. [Apr 2006, p.108]",
"Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a nice entry in the franchise. A good balance between shooting and exploration, it could be a great link to the next entry in the series. However, the lack of online co-op campaign it's a big mistake.",
"Numerous playable characters are a big plus, but the repetitive enemies and environments are not. However, I'm always a fan of good cooperative play, which this title successfully incorporates. [Nov 2004, p.149]",
"We loved it from start to finish and, when we finished, we just carried on fighting online and against our mates to keep the fun alive. Naruto: Rise of a Ninja is the incredibly well balanced and varied game that the Naruto universe has been crying out for.",
"Oil Rush delivers a new experience within the Tower Defense genre and Unigine Corp. delivers a decent game. The flaws of Oil Rush are the lack of variety and freedom within the game. Despite these flaws, the game is a real brainteaser at times.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition is the best version of Monolithsoft’s masterpiece. Its additions serve to streamline the experience and make an already great game that much better. Its expansion Future Connected gives some much needed closure on one of the story’s best and most complex characters while spicing up the exploration and combat in a fun, new way. If you’re not already a fan, this version might just hook you like it has so many others.",
"The Big Con is a bright, fun and surprisingly wholesome crime spree through a Saturday morning cartoon version of 90s America. You might develop a compulsion for kleptomania, you might feel bad for picking hundreds of pockets, but at least you'll laugh along the way and feel cool doing it.",
"Griefhelm isn't a bad game, but the parts that make it good only work in isolation, not with each other. That drags the whole experience down, however excited you might be for the battles.",
"With mesmerizing music and gameplay to boot, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is an addictively entertaining experience that once again proves the old analogy that if it aint broke, don't fix it! Bravo!",
"The title lacks a lot of strategic variety in its weapons and a little in its ships as well. This may strongly enforce the idea of close quarters fighting, but it might also limit how a person can play the game.",
"Valkyria Revolution is a game that is just wrong in so many ways, we wonder how it could end up this way. The cutscenes are way too long, the story is bland and it is just so frustrating all together.",
"If you’re looking for a deep single-player experience with a lot of modes and cutting edge presentation, leave All-Pro Football 2K8 on the bench. But if you’re simply looking for straight-up solid football to play online or with friends, All-Pro Football 2K8 answers the call.",
A fascinating premise that is used not only to create a set of mind-bending puzzles but to ruminate on the nature of reality. It’s just a shame about the controls and the short running time.,
"A triumphant return for the series, albeit one slightly spoiled by a ridiculous name change and irksome DRM. Nonetheless, the game manages to be simultaneously slick and expansive, complex yet simple to learn. As I myself discovered, if you're yet to try the series, now is a good time to get involved.",
"But if you're looking for a modern Sonic game which stays faithful to its roots, is fun to play and is a worthy title on its own merits, look no further. Finally, Sonic Colors is that game we've been waiting for.",
"As enjoyable as anything you'll play this year. The mechanics and weapons can leave something to be desired at times, but 'one more go' syndrome is seldom this acute and this is by far the game's biggest strength. [Christmas 2003, p.90]",
"On its surface, Röki delightfully explores a rarely visited branch of Scandinavian folklore, but delve deeper into this thoroughly charming fantasy adventure and you’ll find a beautifully told, emotionally engaging narrative that’s sure to resonate with players of all ages.",
If you’re a fan of Sega though you’ll simply love what Sumo have done with Superstars and the online tennis matches will certainly keep you coming back for more once you have lapped up the Superstars mode.,
"An enjoyable strategy game as long as you are OK with the fact that its gameplay is distinctly old school at heart. If you're looking for innovative play and strategic depth look elsewhere, but otherwise it’s a pulse-pounding, mouse finger-twitching good time.",
"If you are a sucker for pretty graphics and a rich narrative then you had better stick with the console versions of Grand Theft Auto, but anyone looking for an excellent handheld version of the game will delight in the complexity this title has to offer.",
"I can’t praise Valkyria Revolution‘s story enough. It’s a clear-eyed meditation on the horrors of war – even, perhaps especially, justified war. If the developers had found a way to make the dreary, repetitive combat as worthwhile as the story that frames it, this would have been an incredible game.",
"I was really pleasantly surprised at the tremendous amount of content I was able to get for such a small price and even more pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with it. If you're looking for something to workout your mental muscles and don't want a plot driven game, then I can't more highly recommend Quarrel.",
"Neon White is as addictive as it is challenging, with plenty of replayability and varied gameplay, looking gorgeous at every step. It's a magnificent take on the FPS-genre, building complex and thrilling levels where simply pulling the trigger isn't enough.",
"Considering how amazing the graphics look compared to the first Ghost Recon, it's amazing there isn't more slowdown - although I'm thankful there's not. The online games are surprisingly smooth.",
"Despite its visual shortcomings, World of Final Fantasy Maxima still brings back the charm we all fell in love with two years ago. This crossover still feels like an excellent celebration for the series, spoiling long-time supporters with classic gameplay and a fanciful tale filled with Final Fantasy fervor.",
"It does it's job incredibly well, creating a hard core totally realistic flight sim that puts the player in full and total control of everything. Perfect for a flight sim enthusiast, or someone who wants to become a pilot. However, the game losses a point for having such a difficult learning curve due to an over-abundant number of options and controls, and the lack of a nice training mode to get players accustomed with the game.",
"Hiroki's journey and his own always-spoken-aloud thoughts are what really hooked me into Trek to Yomi. The more choices I made for the samurai, the more I wanted to see how he would turn out by the game's end. It's not something I expected from the game, and it certainly doesn't redeem all of its negative traits, but Trek to Yomi's story is good enough to be more than something pushing players along.",
Fight’N Rage is a thoroughly enjoyable beat’em up; it’s well balanced gameplay grants no small amount of fun. The only downsides are content locked behind difficult tasks for casual players and poorly done fan-service that takes away from the story’s tone.,
"When it works, TimeSplitters: Future Perfectis a highly enjoyable and addictive title. The times when we were able to get good online games going without any problems were absolutely fantastic, a real reminder of great blazing fast arcade shooters from years past like Quake and the classic ""Unreal.""",
"With a focused approach, looking at the Trojan War, Total War Saga: Troy offers you the choice between following the story of the war or forging your own path, each time feeling different. This is enhanced by unique game mechanics for each faction within the game, though there are sadly a limited number, as well as adding mechanics that all factions work with like the favour of gods. This is backed up by a brilliant resource and city-management system, making this one of the more strategic Total War titles out there. There are some flaws, such as agents mostly feeling useless and a few small niggles with diplomacy and allied AI, but these are outshone by the aforementioned positives and a fantastically tactical combat system due to enhanced units and new terrain, as well as mythical units. Put simply, Total War Saga: Troy is an outstanding first entry from Creative Assembly Sofia and a fantastic entry to the Total War franchise, highlighting what the Saga spin-offs can bring.",
"A Total War Saga: Troy is limited in scope and unit variety. Similarly, its middle-ground approach between a purely historical title and one that's filled to the brim with mythological elements might not please everyone. Still, it manages to entertain owing to unique faction leader mechanics and Divine Will strategies. Grab it while it's free, but wait for a few fixes and balancing tweaks if you're planning on buying it separately.",
"Lock's Quest is definitely a slow burner and takes a while to get going. Invest your time, however, and you'll be rewarded with a solid and competent strategy game. [Dec 2008, p.67]",
"By and large, SotD just doesn&#146;t bring enough to the table. The new missions are fun, but the fact that this expansion has been divided from it&#146;s evil counterpart and the overall sense of the game actually being Disciples II Gold Edition 0.5 makes the game feel like a jip when you can get so much more out of the original Disciples II for a fraction of the cost.",
"Older gamers will likely get bored with the repetitive gameplay that is seemingly void of any overarching sense of achievement. Younger fans will probably have fun going through the world, collecting items and seeing their favorite Neopets.",
"The Big Con is a heart-warming coming of age story that will delight 90s kids, referential-humor enjoyers, and those with sticky fingers. Its relatable protagonist never loses her heart of gold, despite the horrible circumstances she finds herself in, which serves as a shining testament to the dev team’s ability to carefully craft a story using controversial mechanics. If you have $14.99 and 7 – 10 hours to spare, take a look at The Big Con — it’s bound to steal your heart.",
"I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Future Perfect is the best FPS ever. But I will tell you that if you give me a choice between this game and any other FPS (including either ""Halo"" game), I'll choose to play Time Splitters.",
"Full of gags, bawdy humour and pratfalls (what other game gives you the chance to shoot bananas at the feet of citizens for comic relief?) it's got charm to spare. Unlike Sakaguchi's biggest hit, The Last Story's title is more likely to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it represents compelling proof that there's still life in the old JRPG yet.",
"And while there’s little aside from the inclusion of the glaive in combat that could really be considered an innovation, it’s still something that can keep a solid hold of the player’s attention throughout.",
"Strong graphical elements power this title along. It is amusing and entertaining. That said, veterans of the side-scrolling arcade-like adventure titles might find it a touch predictable.",
"The task of combining rhythm action and RPG gameplay styles is not one that many developers would have been able to pull off as well as Puuba have with The Metronomicon. As well as a stack of great jams and entertaining gameplay, there’s plenty of polish and enough depth here to keep you stepping back to the dance floor.",
"When compared with its original counterpart from PS3, Hyperdimensiondimension Neptunia Re:Birth 3: V Century doesn't have many new elements as we would like, just some added minor functions. However, it's thanks to the improvements that the developers tried to include in the previous remakes that make this entry in one of the best iterations of all the franchise. If you haven't played any game of the series, you could easily try this one.",
"Beneath the emotional tale and a superb cast of characters lies an abundance of shallow filler content with no real purpose It's disappointing to see a game with so much heart struggle under the burden of artificial mechanics. [Feb 2012, p.80]",
"Despite the sheer volume of collecting in front of players, Lego City Undercover's genuine humor, open and expanded gameplay, and lovable characters immediately engage the player and never let go. Even after Rex Fury is behind bars, rebuilding LEGO City (and tearing it down again in your car) will never get old.",
"In any case, this Namco Museum release on the Switch is as good as its precursors and brilliantly accentuated with the local multiplayer focused Pac-Man Vs. but it is currently overpriced and I hope this is not a new trend when it comes to future retro gaming releases on the Switch.",
"The game's major emphasis on telling a complete and engaging story saves what might have otherwise been a let down in terms of actual gameplay. The interactive elements are simple and, though they might not cut it with gaming veterans, should be just fine for most players looking for a good storytelling experience.",
It's not about outmatching cunning opponents or solving complex puzzles. It's a game that scratches an itch that is so base and so primal that you can't help but smile as you eviscerate your saccharine enemies only to gorge yourself on their bloody entrails.,
"It dashes a bit of action-RPG into the classic Mario recipe with delicious results. If you're a more casual Mario fan, or just afraid of bruising your masculine pride, you might be better off with New Super Mario Bros., which should be out by the time you read this article.",
"Blue Byte needs to ask itself some hard questions about just where it strayed from the path of success. Until it's willing to confront those questions, its flagship series will continue foundering on the shoals of obscurity.",
"A good game with average visuals. Although it may seem easy to play, it's hard to master. Probably it's weakest aspect is that it abuses certain songs instead of different ones that give the game some variety.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition brings to Nintendo Switch one of the best modern role-playing games ever created: the visual element, the main weakness of the title, has been updated with care and respect for the original work, as well as the musical rearrangements. The game mechanics are still incredibly good today, confirming how mature Monolith Soft's work was at the time of publication.",
"The game's odd, dark storyline will keep you pushing onward to the conclusion. The patients' experiences are creepy and compelling, particularly since you're only given bits and pieces of the equation at a time.",
"South of Midnight is a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming. It’s focused, filling out its 12-hour runtime nicely without ever dragging or relying on unnecessary padding. Beyond those basics, however, is a certain heart and artistry that elevates the whole package, inviting you to peer into the deep American South through its folklore, nature, and culture. It might not be the most profound exploration of family life, but it’s delivered in ways that feel authentic. From its striking art style to the evocative tunes that bring big story moments together, Hazel’s journey is a captivating one no matter where you come from.",
"Overall, the evolution is positive, but the single year development cycle is really hard to ignore with all the little issues and frustrations that the game shipped with. The menus are bad and there are far too many bugs in this year's iteration of EA Sports FC 25. The slower gameplay and move to deeper tactics are features I actually really enjoy, but I can totally understand how many fans might be disappointed at this move away arcade style play to a more methodical approach. There's no reason not to pick it up, but wait on the frequent sales and discounts the game will see.",
"It’s hard not to be awestruck by what Monolith Soft has achieved in revitalising this classic Wii title, bringing it to a new generation and giving it the tender love and care that it so obviously deserves.",
"The art and music are dripping with style, the mechanics are easy to learn and offer enough wiggle room to be challenging without demanding perfection, and the story is full of heart — if a bit corny at times. If this game looks even remotely interesting, don’t sleep on it.",
"The Framed Collection might be just another mobile port, but it is one that is right at home on the Switch. You might not spend that much time with the two games included, but you’ll enjoy every scene that you play.",
"So easy to pick up and play that you are bound to have fun, even if you don't know what you are doing. You can stumble your way into some of the most excellent combos you can see without memorization or perfect timing.",
"Most of the puzzles were well-designed and I appreciated the chance to put my problem-solving skills and spatial awareness to the test, but the game is insolently short. I finished the campaign in approximately two hours, but it can be done much faster even without skipping the cut-scenes. [11/2020, p.54]",
"Yars' Revenge is a fairly competent shooter and gives new life to a gaming classic. It has a decent story, and looks great on a huge display, but the voice acting and sound really detract from the overall appeal of the product, which in turn sucks the life out of all the action on screen. With a short story, and no real multiplayer, Yars' Revenge is a hard-pressed sell to any but the most die-hard of shooter fans.",
"If you&#146;re into what we call the thinking man&#146;s (or woman&#146;s) RTS, you owe it to yourself to check out Homeworld 2. If you&#146;re tired with the seemingly never-ending stream of first person shooters, give it a try - chances are, you will enjoy every bit of this as we have.",
"Would you bother with a substandard title when you can purchase something like ""Gran Turismo"" or ""Hot Pursuit 2"" for a scant few dollars more? No, you wouldn't bother, which is good because you shouldn't bother.",
"The Bat could not have hoped for a better send off. Graphically astounding, narratively compelling, and featuring two utility belts full of new gadgets. This is bat-time very, very well spent. [September 2015, p72]",
"Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is a solid but unspectacular space shooter. As the first (to my knowledge) of its kind on Nintendo Switch though, it's a worthy starting place. It'll provide a long-lasting experience for those who approach it like the mobile-focused title that it is, while those expecting a deeper console experience may unfortunately find it a bit lacking. Either way, no-one can deny that it performs well and looks pretty.",
"Forgotten Fields, at first glance, is intriguing, meaningful, and deep. And maybe it is — it certainly has its beautiful moments that make you yearn for tropical beaches. But stunning cinematics and dazzling soundtracks can only carry a game so far, especially when movement sticks, cameras are broken, and gameplay itself just feels overall unfinished. Forgotten Fields is done — it’s playable — but I would love to see a lot more work before I can truly recommend this narrative game about narratives.",
"More action than RPG, Fallen Legion: Sins of an Empire focuses everything on the battlefield: story, character development, and the choices that will affect the entire kingdom. The unique take on ATB combat is perhaps Fallen Legion's greatest strength.",
"Neon White is flawless from a gameplay perspective and is not only stylish and incredibly satisfying, but a magnetic execution of a fascinating idea. There's nothing else quite like it, and you'd be doing yourself a massive disservice if you don't at least give it a try.",
"It makes you feel. It makes you think. With grand set pieces and rich narrative turning points, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth consistently gives you reasons to care, to sit at the edge of your seat, wide-eyed, wondering what the future holds. Even with the groundwork laid by the original game, there is a sense that anything can happen, that the future remains unwritten.",
"I wanted to love this game, I really did; the first stage showed so much promise but the lack of content and variety cemented this as an average game with a killer soundtrack and lofty aspirations.",
"Blade Kitten is based on a internet comic and the comic is fun, but the game isn't. The gameplay is in 2D and way too simple, you're weapons are too strong and the many bosses doesn't deliver a competition. The basis is here and let's hope that any sequel will be better.",
"As good as the control and visual re-enactment of the real-life planes come across in Aero Elite, AM2 and Sega drop the ball somewhat when the players become proficient armchair pilots and start itching for new challenges beyond those of the Training missions.",
"Need for Speed Unbound is a game that favors glamor and style over substance. It’s an absolute visual and aural treat. Don’t get me wrong, the art direction is phenomenal, especially with the combination of unique cel-shaded effects and photo-realistic graphics. I mean, they even got A$AP Rocky to feature. I keep wanting to push the pedal to the metal and thoroughly enjoy what the game has to offer, but the endless bloat and grind to get there is beyond disheartening and frustrating. Criterion has promised free content updates in the future, so here’s to hoping it satisfies the needs of the Need for Speed community. But what Unbound has to offer at this moment is a high price tag, a cliche narrative, and an average racing experience.",
"If the actual tennis wasn’t tedious and mundane, you wouldn’t have to ask whether Sega Superstars Tennis was just used to justify a reunion of Sega characters, or the other way around.",
"Progression is player-driven, combat is even more entertaining, and an array of other adjustments makes it one of my favorite RPGs from a mechanical perspective. I just want all of that integrated with a story that isn't laughable and borderline insulting, and that's where Final Fantasy XIII-2 falters. [Feb 2012, p.88]",
"There is a saying that sometimes less is more and this is something that should have been on every computer screen during development. It feels as if Mugen Souls was never fully finished and to try and cover this up, the player was handed a multitude of gameplay mechanics that unfortunately do nothing to add to the overall value of the game.",
"For all of the things that Madden NFL '10 does right, it's certainly not the perfect experience. It's easily the finest incarnation of the series since the arrival of the 360 and PS3, and it signals the first true statement as to how the future of the series is going to be.",
"A faithful retelling of an epic story by developers who are obvious fans of Frank Herbert's epic works, Dune is a slightly above-average third person action adventure with some frustrations that shouldn't take too much away from an otherwise decent game.",
"This is not the straight port or remake of the original GameCube Monkey Ball I might have asked for, but it’s a great game in its own right that brings to light a lot of what I loved about those earlier entries in the franchise. This is a lively, amusing video game that is stuffed with challenging marble-rolling stages, good-natured multiplayer games, and a lot of charm.",
"The game is full of charm, from the easily-distinguishable block types and hero in dressing gown, to the sequences that detail the game’s story and a delicate hint mode. [July 2007, p.93]",
"Gears of War 2 does everything you wanted the original to do and then some. I have never been so hooked on a game. I couldn't put it away until I beat it. I just couldn't get enough of the intense action, the beautiful visuals and I especially couldn't get enough of the story.",
"Yes, it's better than Final Fantasy XIII, but the legendary franchise needs more than that. Fans of FFXIII will probably be happy with this one, but older gamers will be disappointed.",
"Monochroma is a game that I wanted to enjoy, and I thought it would be worthwhile even halfway through the adventure. But things really go off the rails as you push onward, with most of the later puzzles demanding precision that's just not possible.",
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! feels like a fitting, worthy new entry in the long-running series. There’s a rich mixture of single and multiplayer/online modes on offer here, and though the AI bots can leave something to be desired, this is overall a well-rounded and appealing package that’s sure to appeal to any action puzzle fans. We’d give this one a recommendation to anyone looking for an addictive puzzler that doesn’t require too much mental investment to ‘get’ and that keeps you on your toes. The simple and brilliant game design on display here is admirable and it’s sure to eat up hours of your time once it gets its hooks in you.",
"With gameplay that is both simplified and complex, solid controls, attractive presentation, online multiplayer and a touching, well-paced plot, this title can be considered as a definitive entry in its genre.",
"The blu-ray version of Resident Evil Revelations 2 includes all the episodes and the key DLC. It doesn't add too much content to the digital season pass, but if you're looking for the most complete edition, this is it. A fun and enjoyable game that is far from being the best Resident Evil, but at least it's one of the most fun among the recent entries.",
"This is not a title to sit down and play five minutes worth before you run out for errands. But if you devote some time to learning about horses and the racing itself, Gallop Racer 2006 is surprisingly rewarding.",
"Game of Thrones will give you some pretty cool moments, especially when you start feeling the weight of your decisions. Overall, there’s a good chance you’ll be disappointed and frustrated with the game, rather than being mesmerized by an epic tale and great characters. You know, great characters really aren’t THAT great, unless we have enough time to know them.",
"In a world where driving titles such as Gran Turismo and Ridge Racer rule, Racing Gears Advance stands out as a breath of fresh air; a driving game that is simply out to entertain the masses with an incredibly developed sense of excitement and panache.",
"Concord presents great gameplay as a first person shooter while taking us back to simpler times with a traditional progression system. Unfortunately, its lack of personality means that it fails to capture the attention it should in a genre where there are already too many games.",
"With a comprehensive tutorial system, Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the best fit game for people new to the genre to wrap their minds around it. Equally, for more experienced strategy fans, the superb balance that made the historical events the game is based on so fascinating also make for the near-perfect strategy game.",
"Ultimately, Monster Energy Supercross 25 is a competent but unspectacular entry in the series. The improved visuals and deeper career mode are welcome additions, but the core gameplay remains largely unchanged. The steep learning curve and inconsistent online experience may deter some players, while seasoned veterans may find the lack of groundbreaking innovation disappointing.",
"In the end Madden 10 is the kind of game that I am willing to look past the shortcomings because what’s good is really, really good. It’s worth putting up with the faults in order to experience what works.",
"Anything but original or entertaining. With the same features of previous installments to be found, this latest expansion looks more reminiscent of a bad rerun waiting to be cancelled instead of a supplementary package to what should have been a solid hit.",
"Age of Wonders 4 might be overwhelming at first, but it's brimming with potential and gives you the tools to tell unique stories with your chosen hero. The nearly decade-long gap between releases gave Triumph the chance to polish Age of Wonders 3's weak points and come up with substantial improvements to combat and presentation. The result is one of the best grand strategy games in ages.",
"It isn't wildly creative or original, it's just a well-developed Lost Vikings clone that keeps in mind its target audience: Transformers Animated fans. I just wish the ""transforming"" part didn't feel so separate from the rest of the experience.",
"In those areas where Diablo II: Resurrected attempts to improve on the original, it absolutely succeeds. It looks infinitely better, it’s more accessible to a wider range of gamers, and it mostly feels like it deserves to live on current-gen systems. At the same time, some of the changes seem arbitrary when looked at through the lens of what could have, and should have, been updated. Part of Diablo II: Resurrected feels wonderfully nostalgic and timeless, but another part feels mired in outdated mechanics from decades past, and pretty graphics alone can’t fix that.",
"South of Midnight has so much soul that the specifics don’t matter. It told a story that has been criminally undertold in the games landscape so far, with fresh characters, in a darkly intriguing world. I’d take all the underwhelming combat in the world if it meant we got more games like this one.",
"And while the game never quite reaches ""Incredible"" levels, it's still a good enough game to warrant checking out if you enjoyed the movie. Just don't expect to have to spend much time with it.",
"Punch Time Explosion had a good opportunity to impress 3DS owners hungering for a worthwhile experience following the handheld's weak launch lineup, but it simply falls in line with the other disappointments. Cartoon junkies may love seeing their heroes in action, but those used to Smash Bros. polish will want to pass on this one.",
"Aside from the repetitive gameplay, this is a game that Fate fans will absolutely enjoy playing and exploring in an officially released Fate game, since the Stay Night visual novels don’t seem to be coming out anytime soon, including the several other games that spawned from this franchise. From a gaming perspective is a flawless execution of what a Servant would do against an army, but is mechanically challenging.",
"Immortal Unchained could have been a great attempt to get its name between action-RPG’s as Dark Souls and The Surge. However, adding guns to the well-known formula didn't save the game from having way too many technical and balance problems during release.",
"There’s a lot to enjoy here in a well-rounded package, with plenty of replay value thanks to the range of different heroes, collectibles and high-scores to aim for, as well as the online and offline multiplayer options.",
"As close to a full console title as we've seen on Xbox Live Arcade to date. Its story mode is fun foray into the twisted universe of Alan Wake, even if some of what's going on won't always make complete sense to any but the most dedicated of fans. Remedy has admirably tackled the repetitive nature of the campaign in order to get the most out of the the content they had, although it does start to wear thin at the midway point. Thankfully, a strong final act and a ridiculously addictive Arcade mode more than make up for it.",
"Showdown is a great first effort into multiplayer madness beyond co-op for Yacht Club Games that I am sure will carry lessons into their next project. Showdown is a compliment to the entire Treasure Trove package that does not encroach on the core experience. Some people will love Showdown’s addition and others will brush it off to the side. It’s like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae; a sweet inclusion, but not essential to the overall enjoyment of the package.",
"Jagged Alliance: Rage! Is the closest thing we have to the greatness of Jagged Alliance 2. It's a very trimmed game, delivering the experience rather than a carbon copy of the series. You still have to care for your mercs' health and gear, as well as carrying capacity, but at a much less grognardy level. I dunno if 1.13 mod fanatics will be pleased, but for the others, it's a good introduction to what Jagged Alliance used to represent.",
"Suda 51s latest piece manages to be both predictable and hollow. As an action game it is unfinished and poorly built and as an art game it only manages to shallow posing. The graphics may be beautiful and the soundtrack even more so, but that is not enough to make Killer is Dead worth your time.",
"With five new characters, improved online play and extra modes, Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate is a great deal at $40. Fans who own 2012's model may not like buying a brand new game, but everybody else needs to pick it up on the strength of the single-player story mode.",
"Tropico 3’s gameplay hasn’t changed much since the first iteration thus making it difficult for the players to decide whether the new graphics is enough to make want to be El Presidente once again… But if you’ve never played at it before, this is a great chance!",
"Reality Fighters forces players to follow what's going on with its augmented reality functions. So players will end up sitting in their living room looking at a game that takes place in their own home, if they see anything at all. And as a bonus, it throws in terrible humor.",
"The dialog and voiceovers are the best features of the game. The developers acknowledge this by offering, as an unlockable, a behind-the-scenes documentary of Mr. Campbell performing his voiceovers for the game.",
"At first glance, a Great shooter with catchy story and interesting weapons and upgrades. Its cons are unveiled during play – AI, touch controls and ""too narrow"" level design. [June 2012]",
"Some of the missions prove incredibly difficult, especially when players need to defend a position against overwhelming odds, but the fast-paced battles and great multiplayer features make it all worthwhile.",
"An ambitious game that’s fun while it lasts. Unfortunately, it lasts a little too long, especially if you’re dying to see what Annie looks like dressed up as a Breath of Fire character.",
"There are a few minor problems, such as coloration of some uniforms (Vikings helmets are more blue than purple) and the helmets lack the sharp glossy look of other games. But when it comes to facial animation, NFL 2K3 is way ahead of the pack.",
For cycling fans this is an appealing title despite its flaws. It gets the idea of real road-racing across and does incorporate the same kinds of strategies your heroes do in real life. Unfortunately as a game though it’s limited.,
"If you have even a remote sense of twisted humor, I highly recommend checking out this game. It is definitely the best rabbit, saw blade killing, monster slaying simulation currently available.",
When a video game like Dead or Alive 5 throws around words like “sensual design” they’re really covering up for its appeal to the lowest common denominator of who they think are playing the games: Men who stare at boobs. Let’s be honest because the game’s producers certainly won’t be.,
"One of the more unfortunate things about this game is that for a supposedly comical kart racer, the drivers’ personalities rarely come through. At its worst, NASCAR Kart Racing stands out as little more than a marketing opportunity in a sport already filled with them.",
Arma III raises the interest of the franchise and improves a many points from previous episodes ... but we're still waiting for the solo campaign to finally confirm this positive trend.,
"In an industry still obsessed with lifelike visuals, gratuitous violence, and tear-jerking stories, Wattam is a welcome remedy. Though short-lived and bizarre is its design, it has a joyous cleansing effect that will have you grinning ear to ear.",
"Much like Danganronpa before it, despite its problems my time with Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus will be hard to forget. I’m thankful I waited until this updated version to give it a whirl; with a silky smooth frame rate and high resolution, the visual elements really get to sing. Even when I wasn’t fully on board with where the story was going, Rain Code made me think, which is high praise for a game about a deadly goth girlfriend puking rainbows and shooting heart-shaped laser beams from her face as a means of exposing criminal conspiracies.",
"It's certainly not revolutionary, but it's a simple, fun and very likeable game. It's perfect for dorm rooms or back-from-the-pub entertainment, as the controls don't take long to grasp and the gameplay isn't exactly rocket science.",
Camera angles at its best. There is no need to control the camera angle if it's already position in the best possible matter – which seems to be how the camera works all the time. This is perfection at work.,
"Looking at the graphics and sounds, Castlevania is fine. The controls are very simple, but at the same time not always that good. Overall a great Castlevania game, but not for full price.",
"With over 20 massive levels in which you destroy, search, escort, hostage rescue, defend, create diversions, ambush, and much more, you will have fun finding new ways to infiltrate the Kewletts each time around.",
"South of Midnight is that game that we all need to play at a certain time. Not because it is an indispensable masterpiece in the catalog of all players. But because it offers a fun proposal, limited and full of pampering that serves to “detoxify” us from that bad habit that the industry has taken of offering us everything bigger and bigger.",
"Rock of Ages 2 is still a fun and madcap adventure, giving you the ability to desecrate art and history, but the game has a habit of taking a little too long with each match. The humor and character carry it a long way and the battles can still come to very tense nail-biting finishes, but a better balance on the damage and more interesting map designs would do a lot to help give it more legs.",
"Tropico 3 is nothing particularly special in concept — it's basically SimCity in a bunch of fictional Cuba-like nations. The historic incidents and your handling of them, combined with small touches like avatars and online functions, make for a fun and distinct experience.",
Namco Museum is a worthwhile release and the inclusion of Splatterhouse was a win-win for me. For $30 I think it’s worth the price to revisit some of Namco’s classic games and have the option to play them anywhere.,
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! has everything we could wish for about Taito's classic. A new installment that engages from the first moment, with a gameplay as fresh and addictive as the first day. A multitude of mechanics that significantly increase the difficulty and depth of the game, as well as multiplayer and online options that significantly lengthen the life of an already infinite game. The usual charm and charisma of Puzzle Bobble remains intact.",
"The game's saving graces are its graphics and well-balanced races, and if you crave long backbreaking campaigns, you'll find plenty to keep you occupied here, but it's too bad that Black Hole couldn't have fleshed out the game's embryonic innovations to deliver something more daring and less imitative.",
Black Book is an intriguing game due to its unique subject matter. The problem is that the game's pace is too slow and you risk getting bored and missing out on all the good stuff in the game.,
"Monaco borrows elements from Ocean's Eleven, Thief, Prison Break and Commandos to create a great stealth game suitable for both hardcore and casual fans. The game can be played all the way through on your own, but Monaco is best experienced with three other players, allowing you to form a crack team of thieves that can steal anything that isn't nailed down.",
"With the right friends, Melbits World is a cute and clever exercise in collaboration and coordination that offers more than just a gimmicky control system and some sweet presentation but the very young and the jaded old might not get much from it and solo players aren't catered for at all.",
"Bizarre moments and a great combat system, mixed with a psychological thriller that raises more questions than it gives answers; Killer is Dead is a typical Suda51 game. The game is therefore only suitable if you’re open to an anime-style of storytelling or if you have an unquenchable thirst towards hack and slash action games out of Japan.",
"While taking on legions of shambling undead with Morgan's fists was a genuine high point, it's not enough to make up for the fourth-class experience that Riptide is. I forgave many of the original Dead Island's problems since it had such a fresh, exciting vision, but Riptide lacks the same heart. Don't get me wrong, though—the developers don't need to reinvent the wheel every time (and more of a good thing is usually a good thing) but there's no excusing the slapdash production values and shortage of good ideas on display here.",
"While I want to give Konami credit for trying something new with the series, the obvious missteps and overlooked elements of Castlevania Judgment makes the game look and feel like a cheap cash-in.",
"Wii-makes walk a thin line already, but when a game can't iron out even the most blatant bugs (three second freezes occurring constantly in general play?), it's obvious that it's more about making a few quick stacks of cash than putting any real effort into a package.",
"A great game. Because of the differences from previous iterations it may be a little disappointing to die hard Mario Kart purists. But for anyone who likes the series in general, the decision to get this game is a no-brainer.",
"Rent it, play it with your friends, and see what you think. I'm not saying you can't have fun with Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 if you're in good company, but you'll probably agree with me in that the mini-games are a little weak.",
"Outrun Online Arcade is largely the same game that it's been for the last 23 years, which is to say that it's a simple and fun arcade racer that works great as a time killer, but it's nothing that's going to entertain for hours at a time.",
"All Firefall’s opening does is shove your face right up against grubby textures, shoddy animations, and invisible walls. Your first two hours with it will see you retreading ground completing repetitive fetch quests for characterless NPCs in a world that does nothing to excite the eye...You have to wade through that swill of a beginning to understand Firefall’s potential.",
"The intro of the game makes you wait for more than you will get. The storyline is intriguing and it unfolds in an unorthodox and occasionally unexpected way. Overclocked offers rich and deep characters and a very movie-like experience not often seen in games. Unfortunately, the game lacks challenging puzzles and the dialogue is too simplified. But even with these flaws Overclocked is a nice piece of work and it's story and smooth gameplay makes it worth playing. [Aug 2008]",
Loop Hero is a textbook example of how a strong singular vision can create something truly incredible. It’s a game that is unlike anything I’ve played before and has occupied every spare thought I’ve had since I began. It’s unique gameplay blends many familiar mechanics from a variety of gameplay genres to create an exceptionally satisfying and compelling experience. The fantastic visuals and audio design masterfully complement the gameplay mechanics to feel like an authentically retro product with modern sensibilities. Do yourself a favour and check this one out.,
"While not the most robust of the PlayLink games, Knowledge is Power is still a fun, playable game show that family and friends will easily be able to pick up and play. Games are short, which means that it’s not something you have to dedicate a night to, but also sets you up for rematches galore. The questions are interesting and niche, which makes them harder while at the same time making you feel like you know the answer. The way they’ve implemented the Power Plays is a nice touch, allowing you to slow your opponents down in a game that’s all about speed. So if you’ve been liking the games that Sony has been offering with their new PlayLink initiative, Knowledge is Power is another one to pick up.",
"Samorost 3 is a relatively short journey, taking about five to six hours to beat and a little more to fully complete. That time is jam-packed with delightful characters, stunning scenery, and clever puzzles, so while it may be brief, it's certainly time well spent. For anyone who appreciates Amanita's previous titles or the point-and-click adventure genre in general, Samorost 3 comes highly recommended.",
"As great as the campaign is, the game will see its longest legs from multiplayer. And from the multitude of competitive match types to the addictive and strategic co-op Horde mode, what felt like a hugely entertaining afterthought in the original Gears now easily stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the campaign.",
"Ninja Council 2 attempts to focus more on the fighting and less on the exploration, but fails to retain the tight gameplay of the original in the process, making for a game with far more detail and style, better character animations, but a weak overall feel.",
"I can't even begin to describe how addictive the gameplay has become. I actually found myself bouncing around in my chair and holding my breath when I would try to throw one more rotation into a trick. [Nov 2003, p.134]",
"If you're after a simple, mindless distraction that can be enjoyed by you and a buddy on the couch… well, there are plenty of other games on Live Arcade and elsewhere that can do that, and do it better.",
"The core ideas are there, and the challenge is refreshing in these days of infinite lives and sometimes simple gameplay. But the unpolished controls and targeting system cause massive headaches on top of being challenged, thus making the game more difficult than it should be.",
"Despite its flaws, there is some merit to Tech Support: Error Unknown. It does capture the feeling of working in a fast paced support environment. You get a sense of sympathy towards the worker’s plight just by going through the motions. However, it doesn’t do a great job of integrating anything else into the equation due to its unwillingness to open up.",
"Die hard fans of Iron Man will really appreciate the smooth controls and frantic gameplay. After all, the game feels like you've stepped into the toughest part of a comic. However, if you're just a regular gamer, you're going to want to pass on this title. The repetitive missions, terrible story, and ugly cutscenes are not worth your hard earned cash.",
"Although Hard West 2 delivers on some awesome visuals and sound design, its gameplay didn’t hook me and its characters never grew on me. For those looking to scratch the itch of a turn-based tactics game until a wave of games releases in the fall of 2022, then this could be right up your alley.",
"The game consistently manages to put impressive, holy crap-worthy stuff on-screen. Your ears get their fair share of candy, too. Voice work is almost always right on and the music is epic, foreboding, and dangerous.",
"There is so much depth involved with the tremendous amount of variables, that you can get your party decimated in a short few seconds, even though you have all of the upgraded armor and weapons that money could buy.",
"A big step up from the previous title. It delivers on the classic Western setting, provides lots of gameplay options, and even lets you pull off bank heists with friends online. And without a single assault rifle to be found, it's a welcome change of pace from the standard shooter fare.",
Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars shows that the original Command & Conquer is back with a vengeance. Very good work all around except for some of the early missions that are annoyingly easy. [Apr 2007],
"Alongside the single-player campaign, there's an entertaining multi-player mode that enables two people to build armies and defences and go to war. Whilst this is only local play, it does mean that Lock's Quest makes a more worthy addition to your DS collection.",
A great sequel that is once again giving glory and pouring new blood to this legendary series. Heroes VI is a tribute to the finest titles of the series – a very good reason to play it.,
"This beautiful adventure transports you to an amazing world filled with a wonderful soundtrack. As far as gameplay is concerned, Yonder never becomes complex, instead opting for a simple, but charming experience. Highly recommended.",
"Precise aiming on the run is a little dicey on the PSP, and the loading times can be extraneous, but it's a small price to pay to get Motoko and company into your mobile unit. [Oct 2005]",
"Legends of Eisenwald is one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises that we engaged with this summer. Intriguing storytelling, thrilling plot twists and ambiguous morale decisions are wrapped up in an excellent medieval/ feudal environment. The simple yet addictive turn based battle system, the many upgradeable military units and a well built economic system, raise the game’s status to “totally recommended” for the genre’s fans.",
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the umpteenth demonstration of the unfortunate union between gamepad and strategic games. The developers have thought of a great product, with many potentialities on paper. The title is destroyed by the bad mapping of controls and a not so impressive technical realization.",
"The gameplay is nothing special, and it isn't particularly trying to be. It exists as a framework to tell a story, and plenty of games have excelled with that mindset. But all it has to say is that pollution is bad and it's all your fault. It doesn't inspire change, it doesn't shock, it doesn't even highlight the plight of the animals we share this world with, becoming too wrapped up in casual visual metaphor than with showcasing the harsh reality of what we have done to this world. The bees are dying, but so is my patience.",
"Chaos Wars might draw in some--like fans of the obscure games it's based on, especially those who long for the days of hand-drawn characters and tiny battlefields--but its old-school aesthetic isn't enough to make up for the lackluster production values and uninspired game play. [Aug 2008, p.82]",
"Even while you know that the game isn't the least bit realistic, you keep playing just to see what sort of craziness will happen next. But the novelty of curiosities like Fiji spying on Denmark fades in just a few hours, and when it does, you'll reach for the uninstall icon.",
"After all, a funny and original multiplayer shooter that kept the good from its predecessor, improved some not-so-good mechanics and served a great menu. However, creators made some minor mistakes and several half-way decisions, but as a whole it is a noticeably better product.",
"As a successor to the glorious Ridge Racer franchise Unbounded is quite disappointing, the controls are sluggish, the AI is unfair, the destruction feels superficial. Almost everything that you once associated with Ridge Racer is gone. Thanks to the editor and the well executed online mode it might still be worth a look for some.",
Lego City: Undercover brings legos to GTA style open world. I just miss co-op from the previous lego games and my kids didn't understand long loading times. They thought game dowloaded something from the net. [May 2013],
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a generous and inspiring remaster, finally bringing the game’s visuals in line with its outstanding narrative. It truly feels like this is now the game Monolith Soft always intended it to be, cementing its position as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.",
"A game based of an anime based of the sorcery-school concept... Well, if you are into the anime, go for it. If not, I suggest you give up momentarily. Repetitive and bland action make this title a bore and a chore for your average gamer Joe. But is still better than most of the Harry Potter games.",
Fuzion Frenzy 2 was never asked for and if there’s ever plans for a third edition the game will need a complete gutting before it can be stitched into something that people will want to play.,
"The Xbox is so capable of performing graphics that could blow these out of the water. There is so much to like about this game, but people are going to be turned off by how bad these graphics have made a downgrade from its PC brother.",
"Don't get this game specifically for the driving or the shooting sequences. Rather, pick it up if you appreciate a solid story based action game with the mimicry of ""GTA"" (without all of the bells and whistles).",
"Samurai Warriors 4 Empires is definitely an entry for hardcore Empires fans — with the same repetitive combat, and even reused graphics and audio assets, this release will not do much to convert anyone who isn’t already heavily invested in the series.",
"To be clear, there’s a lot of space in this world for gentle, low-impact games. Wytchwood isn’t a bad game because it’s easier than Dark Souls. Difficulty is not the only reason to play a game. But Wytchwood does let the player down with such a vague and uninteresting story. A game needs a hook, and this story ain’t it. Crafting games make me uniquely aware of how much time I am wasting by playing them. But in the end, I like to look back at the little work of art I made by building a house, or a city, or a space station. In Wytchwood I am just collecting ingredients because the game told me to collect those ingredients. It’s an attractive enough game, but it needs something else substantial.",
"The content is great, but the relative value is horrible. If you are a big Kingdom Hearts fan (and really that’s who this collection is intended for), you’re going to be overjoyed.",
"Overall, Team Ninja has done a great job making Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate worth the double dip with additional modes including team play, and a ‘new’ training mode. The additional features make this the game Dead or Alive 5 should have been.",
"Concord is a clean and well-meaning first-person shooter, with no shady business practices to boot. Its lack of real identity is an issue, and it’s difficult to determine just how much Sony is going to get behind it long-term. However, there’s a polished and beautifully presented experience on offer here, with some interesting tactical team-building systems and sublime animations. Firewalk’s debut may not be out of this world, but it’s genuinely pretty good overall.",
"The adrenaline meter, however, hovers at medium until you reach the boss battles, and there's little replay value unless you're someone who can never get his fill of Naruto ninjutsu.",
"As with previous Sega's 3D Classics, M2 signs a love letter to another arcade hit, making this conversion the best one available for home consoles. They've added a completely new level and little touches and options here and there (like the great 3D effect), but nonetheless the experience is way too short compared to other 3D Classics. But, in the end, if you loved the original, you'll love this conversion.",
"GRIP is a technically sound game and can genuinely offer some exciting racing, as you try to dodge enemy weapons, track hazards and more, all at insane speeds. However, it can also be a confusing game to navigate and also has very unfair rubber-banding which can screw you over more than half the time as you'll find a well-placed rocket right up your rear-pipe just before you hit the finish line.",
"Commandos: Origins stays true to the classic formula, updating it with modern mechanics and solid level design. The gameplay is deep and rewarding—especially for players who prefer brains over brute force. However, the lack of cohesive narrative progression, some technical shortcomings, and occasionally unbalanced abilities prevent it from reaching true excellence. A compelling comeback for those seeking challenge and precision, as long as you're patient enough to deal with its rough edges.",
"If you're looking for a fun adventure in the same vein as ""Luigi's Mansion,"" The Haunted Mansion should be perfect for you. It proves to be good fun without even being too rough or challenging.",
"In motion, it's a painfully beautiful game: in the saturated richness of its colours and the raw exuberance of its backdrops; in the soaring melody of Magical Sound Shower and the husky elocution of the girl who voices the menus; in the hard, brilliant, arcade brashness of it all; above all, in the unique balance and beauty of its handling.",
Rabbids: Alive & Kicking doesn't capture the boundless energy and kooky personality that sometimes makes them so endearing. You should look elsewhere if you want to get a real kick out of the rabbids.,
"In the end, Legrand Legacy: Tale of the Fatebounds may scratch your itch for that nostalgic JRPG experience, but only if you're really desperate for such. Otherwise, prepare to mentally harden yourself to withstand many frustrations as you drag your way through the game. It's a shame that despite the stunning art and music, Legrand Legacy ended up being a very average JRPG, greatly flawed by its questionable choices in the game design and pacing.",
"I'm not condoning adultery with the following analogy but it's the best way I can think of getting my point across; Forza Motorsport is like a wife - it looks pretty, you know what you're getting, you're in it for the long haul but it can become a little irritating and boring at times.",
"Gears of War 2 is the kind of game that third person shooters should try to imitate. We are not talking about the chosen theme or its tactical arcade scope, but instead we want to point out how well the console resources have been used in order to get an impeccable gameplay. A must have. The total shooter.",
"Overall, Quarrel is an enjoyable game that word puzzle fans will really appreciate since such games are a rarity on XBLA. Add an extra layer of strategy from the Risk aspect of the game, and you have a great little game to play when you want to give your brain more of a workout than your reflexes.",
"Nothing short of the best snowboarding game videogames have ever seen, and while there are a few nagging problems, the presentation and execution of a massive, three peaked behemoth that you’ll try your damndest to conquer is pure gaming bliss from the moment you first drop onto the mountain.",
"Based on the Iliad epic, Troy appeals to both Total War veterans and players who want to enter the series. Players looking for a good strategy game should definitely try this game.",
"With great feeling melee combat, gruesome action, solid level design and brutal difficulty, this game is a hell of a lot of fun and is ideal for anyone looking for more first-person action to cure an itch for cooperative fun who doesn’t mind grinding on the side to impress the rats with their better gear.",
"Those Who Remain features an eerie atmosphere, inventive puzzles, and some moments of genuine tension via its shape-shifting world, but fussy controls, one-dimensional stealth, and a narrative that lacks cohesion prevent it from stepping completely out of the darkness and into the spotlight.",
"Fans of Starship Troopers and PvE shootouts should definitely have Extermination in their sights. It offers successful PvE multiplayer, where the piles of dead arachnids that remain there fascinate. However, there could have been more maps and singleplayer is boring and not even Casper Van Dien can save it.",
SiN Episodes: Emergence is a good looking game. It's got some really nice visuals and a really good sense of depth. The audio is a little sparse but at least we're not forced to sit through boring cutscenes just for the sake of forcing a storyline on us every few minutes.,
"As a follow-up, Alan Wakes´s American Nightmare surprises with a new, fresh feeling of horror in unfamiliar surroundings and with an idea for its storytelling that in the end barely graces the main tale, but still takes a lot of cues from it and even manages to give something back. So if you want to know what the hell is going on in Alan Wake, this is a new and very entertaining puzzle piece to a much larger and still quite hazy picture.",
"Overall my suggestion would be, stick the game’s suggestions (hints) on high, enjoy it as a constant stream of brain-dead semi funny entertainment, in a universe you are probably familiar with, and get as much stress-free enjoyment from what admittedly, feels like a pretty polished episodic game.",
"There's a reason why New Super Mario Bros. sold a ton of copies on the DS, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii will continue tearing up sales charts: It's fun for everyone. If you're still on the fence about New Super Mario Bros. Wii, get off the fence and get it.",
"GRIP comes together nicely. There's a bounty of content on hand which, providing you can deal with the frustrations of competition, prove fruitful and rewarding. The core racing keeps me going through a campaign that can border on exhausting. There's a lot of trial and error involved but it's compelling enough with a solid presentation to keep my foot in the door.",
"Undoubtedly the best opus of the license released to date. In addition to the already gargantuan lifespan, further improved in solo and multiplayer thanks to a My NBA mode boosted by the choice of 4 eras, the return of the Jordan Challenge, the co-op mode in My Team and the Career Theater, the gameplay in will delight some. The former crazy dribblers are now limited online and must think collectively, the shooting timing is more demanding, but much fairer and a lot of new animations come to shake up the regulars. Graphically impeccable, taking in immersion with old-school skins for period matches, the title enters the Hall of Fame. Only gray areas, the usual desire (or even need) to take out the credit card to get more VC and advance your player, a matchmaking that is still quite unbalanced and some crashes on certain career quests. Even MJ can have flaws.",
"Regardless of Future Connected, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a must buy for all fans of RPGs, regardless of your history with the series. It is the perfect example of a remaster done right: it retains everything that is excellent about the original, but updates and smooths things in almost every important way. It's an amazing time to be a fan of the series, and I can't wait to see what Takahashi comes up with next.",
"An instant classic. The brilliant mixture of Risk and Scrabble is as simple as it is motivating: You command troops on the battlefield, rage war with words and try to capture all territories. For merely 400 points every hobby tactician should give this cute letter warfare a chance.",
"Okay, so we&#146;re still stuck with crap passwords and not even a difficulty level to boost lastability, but if the movie was a hit with you, then this perfect platformer is one spin-off that&#146;s worth shelling out for.",
"Despite its impressive depth, this game is no masterpiece... But if you find yourself intrigued by its premise, there’s enough quality adventuring here that it can almost become an obsession.",
"Where the game has been severely improved over its last title on the Xbox, on a next-generation system, the hardware is not effectively utilized to make this game a viable choice over its cheaper Xbox cousin.",
"So much more could have been added, from online features to trophies and other collectibles. Sadly, after finishing the story and having a few battle rounds, Punch Time Explosion has little more to offer.",
"Under a cover of GTA free roam mechanics you can find a Wii U exclusive that tries its best to realize children’s dreams of a whole LEGO City to play with, guided by a lovely main story which slowly builds up all its hilarious parody lines and gameplay pieces. Some fits still need work, but the construction seems already quite solid.",
"Koei Tecmo isn't reinventing the wheel here, and that's fine. Samurai Warriors 4 Empires is yet another enjoyable entry into the musou genre, and one that brings a few neat twists on strategy. It won't leave you amazed, but you'll have a good time.",
"Its Story mode is distinctly improved, brought together by a plot which is well acted out and never ceases to amuse. The Arcade component returns with more refinements and online play, cleverly engineered to reduce undue frustration.",
"One of the big problems with making a cheap side-scroller is with the addition of garbage AI, the game is just a lot of run from Point A to Point B, with the beat-up people areas providing barriers.",
The clincher that transforms Homeworld 2 from a good game into a great one is the depth of detail. Every battle is an epic worthy of Lucas' early days; every backdrop a mind-blowing kaleidoscope of nebulae which constantly rams home the very vastness of space. [PC Gamer UK],
"While Splatoon 2 is not a drastic change from the original formula that was available on the Wii U, there are certainly enough additions and alterations that separate it from its predecessor. Some of the maps have been recycled, and one can’t help but wonder if this decision was made to expedite the development of the game. For a system that is currently starved for new, triple-A titles the way that the Nintendo Switch is, it seems plausible that a few corners needed to cut to get the game out the door. Regardless, Nintendo made good on their promise to support the first title in this series, and one can only assume that they will give this title the same amount of love and care. If you own a Switch, this game deserves a spot in your library.",
"These new elements seem to have been thrown in merely for the sake of being different, and the result is a confused mishmash of ideas that is more banal and frustrating than fresh or exciting.",
"Age of Empires: Definitive Edition its a good remaster with great visuals but with a formula that, sadly, feels limited and kinda simple for the genre standards of nowadays. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable game that will appeal mostly to those fans and players who enjoyed the original title from two decades ago.",
"What we basically have here is a glossed-over version of the game with very little addition and a $20 price drop, not to mention some horrible freezing problems that send this game to the showers.",
"The artificial intelligence is improved and ball physics are much more realistic than in the first game, but while FIFA Street 2 makes a good first impression, it gets bogged down by unresponsive player controls and repetitive action.",
"Like ZEN Studios' previous offerings, Zen Pinball 3D reproduces the best aspects of pinball beautifully, and the 3D truly adds to the enjoyment and gets you that much closer to feeling like you're playing real pinball.",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue may not satisfy those who desperately want Kingdom Hearts III, but it is the perfect collection to experience old and new adventures in the Kingdom Hearts universe while we wait.",
"While ""The Sims"" can get deep, The Urbz: Sims in the City is a very light version of the original. This game is designed for girls that haven't yet grown out of the Barbie phase. The Urbz is the shallowest version of The Sims yet.",
"The controls are marred with inaccuracy. Precise movement, which should be very easy based on the simple gameplay mechanics, is amazingly frustrating. Changing direction is an exercise in frustration.",
"Tropico 5 Penultimate Edition is a masterclass city builder with a unique twist that drew me in unlike any other game of the genre. Some of the UI shortcomings are confusing or frustrating, but are not nearly enough of an issue to pass the game up.",
"Ridge Racer Unbounded might be one of the biggest missteps of this generation. Not because it is a bad game, in fact far from it, but because of the lack of explanation and more importantly, the dearth of advertising it has received",
"While I’m surprised that Just Dance 2014 continues the tradition of not letting us import our old tracks, it offers plenty of new features to make the series innovative instead of iterative.",
"By listening to its community, Bohemia Interactive is selling us the most well-polished ArmA yet to this day, with numerous options for in-game content creation. With an exceptional graphics engine allowing a superb rendering and well evolved physics ArmaA imposes itself as the reference of infantry sims. With a very demanding gameplay, ArmA 3 claims its elitism and raises it as a dogma to face the competition. Quite unfriendly to the newbies, Arma can disappoint by its obvious lack of initial content, which should be vastly improved by the community through the content creator toolbox. Unique for its tough challenges hence the feeling of deep satisfaction when you complete a mission, ArmA 3 sets itself as the playground of elite gamers.",
"Topatoi Episode 1 delays its payoff for too long, and in the end exists mostly as a suggestion of a game that might be good to play when (and if) it makes its way to the PSN store. Add the fact that the characters of Topatoi lack any of the charm or personality of your typical platformer cast—their in game models look a little revolting even—and it's a hard game to recommend.",
"Don't Nod is back with a vengeance, with a proposition calibrated for fans who fell in love with the studio thanks to Life is Strange. Lost Records has everything to appeal to an audience that swears by the emotions they experienced playing Max Caulfield in the Arcadia Bay era or even with the Diaz brothers. The story and its direction are undeniably the strong point of Tape 1. ‘Bloom sets the scene and the stakes to create a title that has every chance of becoming a new studio benchmark. It still stumbles at times, notably due to a technical aspect that isn't quite finished. We're obviously hoping that the studio has given itself enough time to ensure that the sequel doesn't suffer the same disruption. So we can't wait to launch Tape 2 and get to the bottom of the story behind this reunion of friends who haven't seen each other for 27 years. We look forward to seeing you on 15 April 2025.",
"An excellent opportunity to discover one of the best J-RPG games ever made. Better graphics, big gameplay improvements and a new story. Definitely, the best option to play Xenoblade Chronicles nowadays.",
"Net of some imperfections, Hunt the Night is a product that manages to entertain for its entire duration and beyond, given the presence of extra modes that offer bread for the teeth of fans of soulslike and the like. The simple and fast combat system, the well-studied puzzles and the goodness of the boss fights make the work signed by Moonlight Games an event not to be missed for fans of the genre, both on Nintendo Switch and on PC.",
"More than four years on, SUPERHOT remains as instantly recognizable and immensely appealing a gameplay concept as it ever was on day one. MIND CONTROL DELETE may feel more like a continuation of a good run, rather than a full expanding upon the foundation, but that doesn’t mean that what new features it does offer up fail in helping to bolster what still remains a fun and ingenious interpretation of first-person shooting and puzzle-solving fused together. While it’s easy to pick out the over-reliance on repeated environments, as much the disappointing lack of committing to the subversive elements of previous, there are just as many — if not more — new additions brought into the fold, that ultimately, rightfully, claim most of the attention. A familiar reflection of what the base game managed it may be, a slew of new threats, devious twists and further reinforcing of smart tactics to compensate for such unpredictability result in MIND CONTROL DELETE ending up a great addition to the SUPERHOT experience.",
"The gameplay is just overwhelmingly underwhelming. Poor exploration, unimpressive combat, and a merely passable narrative can’t be made up for by aesthetics. Which is too bad, because the aesthetics are terrific. The backgrounds have a stunning amount of variety to them and are of almost poetic quality. I suppose if you saw Trek to Yomi and this is what grabbed you, then you’re all set. However, if you want strong gameplay to back that up, then it just isn’t worth the trek.",
"With the War Of The Ring turnbased campaign also receiving some minor though effective tweaks, this is one add-on pack you should snap up like a slavering Warg. Amazing what's possible when consoles don't get in the way, isn't it?",
"The target audience for this Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is clearly nostalgic people. This remaster is a nice starter to wait for the main course: Age of Empires IV. Despite bugs such as a shameful pathfinding and some zoom problems, this is not a lazy version. Graphics and audio improvements are enough to once again enjoy one of the most important games in PC games History.",
"The graphics are on par with the home consoles, the same goes for the content, and PS3 users can have some interesting interaction if they have both versions of the game. All in all, a great addition to Vita's library.",
"While business minutia often drags down world-building sims, Operation Genesis offers enough variety and a bit of real action to not only set it apart but also keep players very satisfied.",
"It's fair to say that most people over the age of about eight will find it ridiculously easy and childlike and it features some typically Manga quirks and moral dubiousness (indeed, one of the themes of the original U.S. series was vivisection!) but as a piece of history and heartwarming my-first action title, it's pleasing in almost every facet.",
"A solid effort - it has some problems, but it's also got a lot of charm and intrigue going for it. The theme, visuals, and music will pull you in, and the story and wealth of options available to you as you play will help keep you hooked.",
"Exceeding already lofty expectations, Gears of War 2 raises the bar a notch for action games this holiday season, and that is no small feat. If you don’t have an Xbox 360 yet, Gears of War 2 is as good a reason as any to compose a short letter to Santa.",
"As beautiful and serene as After Us is, it tells a painful story of a world destroyed by the impact of humans. As you save each animal, the darkness that plagues the environment grows more pronounced, and you’re left wondering if this is a world even worth saving. This adventure will pique the curiosity of any player through its clever platforming sections, environment design, and strong narrative message.",
"Mixing mountain biking with Road Rash-style violence and Tony Hawk's token trick allotment, it transcends conceptual shortcomings, officially clocking in as one of the season's best titles.",
"X-Men Origins Wolverine is a thrilling action game, and it delivers all the violence and the testosteronic action that Logan's fans were asking for. A great combat system is mixed with good level design; on the other side, the difficulty level is not challenging, and there's a lot of repetitiveness in the second half.",
"Overall, The Sexy Brutale is an intriguing title where its mood and narrative stand out the most. While artistically sound, the technical prowess of the title is somewhat lacking. Though the various elements of The Sexy Brutale have been utilized in games past, The Sexy Brutale takes them and makes its own game. The Sexy Brutale is creative, interesting, challenging, and fun. Almost living up to its exceptional name, The Sexy Brutale is a must play title for puzzle and adventure game fans alike.",
"The many Nancy Drew fans and DS adventure gamers may be interested in this title, but I can’t really recommend it to any audience. Even for a younger gamer, the repetitive gameplay will likely get boring before the end, and the tedium will quickly be felt by a more seasoned adventure gamer.",
"To date, there aren’t a whole lot of games like Monaco. There’s action oriented isometrics like Trap Gunner and strategy heavy games like Frozen Synapse, but Monaco succeeds in blending the two playstyles together effortlessly. Even if you aren’t the type who plays nice with others, Monaco offers more than enough content to help you channel your inner thief.",
"In spite of the short length, repetition, and glitches, Regeneration does provide enjoyment to Evil Dead fans. The voice acting by Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi's brother Ted is excellent and the game packs in a surprisingly large amount of dialog between Ash and Sam.",
"Life is Strange is a personal, beautiful and captivating adventure game that builds on the foundation of the friendship between two girls who seek their place in the world. A risky and very emotional game.",
"The best racing game I&#146;ve played in months, and anyone looking to release a title in this genre now should look long and hard at what Rockstar&#146;s been able to pull off here.",
"Yes, Banana Mania is essentially just the kind of Super Monkey Ball game that you'd expect. I just didn't realize how much I've missed this series. The single player levels present a challenging and creative experience, while the minigame offerings make this collection essential to anyone who likes to play local multiplayer.",
"Nebuchadnezzar is not as great as Pharaoh, the legendary city builder in whose footsteps it follows. However, it’s an interesting game that will satisfy your desire to build ancient cities, even if it relies too much on burdensome micromanagement. [05/2021, p.40]",
"Ultimately, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway is a competent karting game. It looks nice, there’s plenty of single player content, and it boasts a strong roster of characters and tracks. But did we need another game in the series? Could the new content and characters not simply be an expansion to the previous release? Questions we’ll never know the answer to. If you already own Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2, you’re not exactly getting a completely new experience. But if you’re new to the franchise and enjoy easy-going karting games, you likely won’t be disappointed with what is undoubtedly the best entry yet.",
"It's adequate-looking, sounds OK, makes a passable attempt at humor, has a decent selection of weapons, a nice set of multiplayer options, and puts up a reasonable challenge. But it doesn't excel in any of these areas.",
"Wytchwood is a dark fantasy indie adventure game that immerses you into a phantasmagorical land with endless troubles thanks to the villainous animal antagonists that inhabit it. Luckily, or not so luckily, you play an old witch who has made a pact with an ancient, black goat that's fond of eating grimoire pages and expects you to do something about the fairytale world's woes. What ensues is hours of hilariously creative dialogue and story, framed by colorful characters, relaxing music, and an enjoyable crafting system. There are always more spells to cast and mushrooms to pick for those that know where to look. Wytchwood is one of those rare gems that supports its rich story with a very successful crafting and gathering system that rewards creative and conniving crones. Collect all the souls and maybe, just maybe, you can enjoy that nap in your rocking chair without fairytale creatures knocking down your door for help. Who are we kidding? There's always another villain.",
"Commandos Origins is, without a doubt, a love letter to the franchise, with familiar sensations and a modern touch. Even so, its ruthless design and some technical flaws make it hard to recommend to the general audience. If you are a hardcore stealth gamer, you should definitively check it out.",
"With a host of extras and the ability to play on a big screen, this is the definitive version of Part Time UFO. A lovely title with the cutest aesthetic in recent memory, you’ll be humming the theme song and smiling as you pick up and play this awesome puzzle title.",
"There is a lot to love about Dead Rising 3’s latest DLC. For $10 it is impossible not to recommend to Xbox One owners who still have the game, especially those with a fondness for classic Capcom titles.",
"A lovely experiment in its own right, Tech Support: Error Unknown is not for the faint of heart. Even at the lowest difficulty, it only comes into its own with an attentive player capable of reading between the lines. Though technical problems exist, they don’t get in the way too much. Recommended for those who’d like to try out something new and different, and don’t have a problem with sticking with the game until it really clicks.",
"Vast, sprawling, beautiful and infinitely playable, Darksiders II is the biggest and best surprise of 2012. So far. It will fill all the time between now and other big hitters. [Issue#88, p.26]",
"Fans of motorbike racing will love this game, with its realistic settings and physics handling. But other players will find themselves torn between the arcade and simulator settings, that are either too easy or too unforgiving, making this a difficult game to get into. Online 12 player races are a blast though.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the culmination at all levels of the current Action RPG. An immense, brave and ambitious work, capable of giving the best possible homage to the original classic while introducing its own vision.",
"American Nightmare is a good comeback for our favourite writer. It's a bit too small and its structure could use some more variety. But, given the price of admittance and the sheer quality of its elements, it's well worth playing.",
"I suspect that people with fondness for the original Pac-Man World, or even just this specific era of platforming games will be the ones who get the most from RePac. It's a style of game that has been out of fashion for a while, but it's simplicity could still hold some appeal. When you can get lovingly re-created versions of the standard-setting Crash Bandicoot series for the price of this though, the value proposition for a remaster of one fairly short and unremarkable game is hard to swallow. One for the fans.",
"For an engine company, Unigine has displayed some solid design with Oil Rush. It plays just as good as it looks, and offers a less micro-intensive strategy alternative. At its heart, it's all about unit distribution, and gathering that critical mass of firepower to shift the momentum in your favour.",
"A decent fan service, nothing more. The great visual representation of the Saints is a good reason for any fan to go for it, but we can't avoid thinking that as fighter or even as a fan service, it could be much more.",
"If you’re after a 2.5D side-scrolling stunt game, the Urban Trial Playground is going to scratch that itch for you on Switch. Sure, it’s riffing off the Trials series, but it’s a fun and lengthy alternative that’s a good fit for Nintendo’s platform.",
"For the first time in years, some peculiar animation glitches reared their heads – don’t think we’re supposed to see inside players’ heads during match build-up, nor the occasional melding of limbs in goalmouth clashes. But that foible and some clunky menus aside, FC 25 puts on an impressive performance, albeit one that could be considered level on points with FC 24. What a shame that the game no longer has any credible competitors to keep EA on its toes.",
"No single aspect will blow you away, but there's enough variety, the puzzles are fun, the controls work well, and you keep moving quickly, so it's a fun ride that's unlikely to bore you unless you try to play through it a second time.",
"This is a VR game that will inspire others to make their own VR games. It's a high-quality product that makes me upset it's an Oculus exclusive. I still think that VR games have a long way to go, but Wilson's Heart is a strong foot forward towards realizing the true impact virtual reality can have. It doesn't rely on jump-scares to freak out the player but instead opts to make them uneasy and uncomfortable with its environment and brilliant setpieces. If you have the capacity to play Wilson's Heart, do it. Then send me a PM so we can talk about all the super cool spoilery moments that are unmatched in the medium and genre.",
"The Thaumaturge is a story game through and through, a game that has the thrilling power of a Netflix series, but in which you can play as yourself. Only the fighting is hardly worth mentioning.",
"This is a perfect example of a game being lesser than the sum of its parts. Solid graphics and sound, arguably the best control in the series, and some decent missions don't excuse crap online and too many bland objectives.",
"This game is short and easy, has a few hidden extras, decent graphics, a great sense of humor, and excellent voice acting. If you're a fan of both action games and Evil Dead, it's worth shelling out the 20 bucks for this, even if it's just to put it on your shelf as yet another collectible.",
The last appearance in the Might & Magic series is a game that intentionally seeks to incorporate new regulars. Characteristics have been reduced and a more dynamic mechanical has been created. Its result is a product that can provide hours of fun but will hardly become our choice for a long time. The amount of technical errors can eventually scare the more impatient players but once corrected... we will find a game with enough quality.,
"An entertainingly substantial, if simplistic take on tower defence warfare, Toy Soldiers War Chest’s thrills are prominent, yet a little dulled by some technical issues and a needlessly greedy pricing model.",
"The title has implemented the high replay value shown in various strategic games based on fantasy worldview. Numerous customizing elements are supporting the diversity in both combat and city management. Whether you are a fan of 4X games or not, you'll eventually find yourself spending quite a time on this game.",
"If you’re an experimental gamer who seeks out the weird and unusual, no matter how unintelligible it is, Killer Is Dead will be right up your alley. For everyone else, the game is bargain bin at best.",
"The Steam blurb for Oil Rush says it ""combines strategic challenge of classic RTS with sheer fun of Tower Defense."" But as far as I can tell there's nothing more Tower Defenseish about Oil Rush than any other RTS in which you build defensive towers -- which is pretty much all of them. I'm not sure Unigine knows what Tower Defense is.",
"This is a long game, trial and error or not. The problem is you may become so frustrated that you have to play this game in spurts or destroy your controller. I'm glad they made this game more difficult, but it borders on the maddening.",
"Dead Cells is a masterclass in excellent roguelike design, mixing together nonstop intense action sequences, gorgeous vistas, and an addictive loop of unlocks and rewards into a beautiful experience that no Switch owner will want to go without. There’s dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of content available here, and though some sense of repetition can creep in every now and then, it’s remarkable how fresh Dead Cells can stay through all those hours. This game is a blast to play, full of visual splendor, and packed with things to do; don’t miss out on this one, it’s a must-buy.",
"Metrico+ is like a math lesson on a Monday morning. Not because it is boring, but because of its ability to withdraw our minds to another reality where numbers are only a backdrop and our consciousness fights to find an exit. Unlike that lesson, thanks to the good sensations its puzzles, numbers and colors leaves us Metrico+ catches us finally.",
"Dead Island: Riptide takes all of the worst elements of that title, removes some of the better ones and adds a few features that are average at best to create something that is wholly underwhelming. Here’s hoping this series is allowed to rest in peace.",
"Rogue Mage is an enjoyable card game that I was happy to spend a few evenings with. However, it lacks the greater depth and addictiveness of classic rogue-like titles for prolonged play. As a result, this version of the cards isn't bad, but it's unfortunately the weakest of all on offer. [Issue#321]",
"For experienced gamers, War Times is routine and simplistic... Still, Strategy First's effort will please real-time strategy enthusiasts looking for a throwback to the genre's glory days, and is fitting for armchair generals and WWII buffs that are RTS newcomers.",
Take a really funny cartoon with all kinds of pop culture references and interesting characters. Add in several jokes that adults will understand and get a belly laugh from but is not too risqué for the kiddies. Throw in some really entertaining scenes like a camel getting the scrub through a car type wash or watching Assil rappel out the nose of a sphinx and you have Ankh.,
"Through the eyes of an exasperated protagonist, Those Who Remain borrows from better games to tell a by-the-numbers horror story with the illusion of morality. Rife with puzzles so simplistic they become tedious, its delivery may leave players in the dark.",
"A blast! The online virtual arcade is the best possible setup for an online fighting game to date. In addition, the sheer number of gameplay modes and unlockable content is outstanding.",
"Majora's Mask 3D wears a new mask, but a mask with little tweaks that keep the essence of the original videogame. It's as difficult, dark and mysterious as 15 years ago. A Zelda for hardcore fans.",
"I was hooked on the gameplay and the story of Jak II almost immediately and my addiction and love of the game hasn’t subsided weeks later. Jak II is, without question, one of the finest gaming experiences I’ve ever had.",
"Then there's stuff that's just disgraceful to Asian people in general. For instance, Li Mei looks like she's a drug-addled prostitute. And this is before she gets punched in the face.",
"Sometimes the search for clues leads me into unpleasant surprises. During my demo, I asked the developer for a heads-up whenever any jump scares were coming up. I'm a total coward when it comes to horror. But I suspect horror fans will take these moments in their stride. The story evolves to include monsters, mysteries and special powers, as I earn abilities to best foes in set-piece action scenes. Otherwise, my character proves to be an agreeably grumpy fellow who just wants to know what the hell is going on. Wilson’s Heart looks like a solid narrative adventure that merges puzzles with combat in a stylish world.",
"Without giving anything away, I’ll just say that it was quite underwhelming. In all fairness, Overclocked is a decent adventure game with a unique premise that’s worth a look if you’re a fan of adventure games. Just don’t expect too much.",
"The new version of Formula 1 by Codemasters is just as solid and enjoyable as the previous editions. And that's the problem here: The game is so similar to its predecessors that it cannot be justified as a ""new release"".",
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII is a very complete strategy videogame that features an absolute control over the elements such as the battles or the alliances. However, its graphics engine is not enough to keep the game running perfectly.",
"Punching healers in the face is fun, pulling people across the map is fun, cutting people up from behind is fun… Stunlock Studios basically took everything good about arena and hero combat and put it all together into one game. They removed the grind, the items, the buildup… and everyone is on the same level playing field.",
"It’s in these combinations that the fun really begins. In order to unlock more of these abilities, weapons, or upgrades, you’ll spend another resource back in the hub world and they’ll unlock randomly from a flashy gumball machine. Sometimes it’s an ability that will snag you the kills, or get you out of danger quickly, and you’ll soon have your favourites. Go Mecha Ball is an otherwise run-of-the-mill roguelike, which is not a damning implication. It’s a bit ‘by the numbers’ but it makes for an addictive delivery of dopamine, one that will challenge your skills, and sometimes your patience.",
"A delightfully tongue in cheek death cult simulator, whose excellent aesthetics stumble over a very high randomness factor. Each new game relies more on blind luck than strategy in its early stages, painfully taking you out of the “Our Fish Lord Cometh” fantasy and reminding you of the underlying mechanical structure. Still, quite a refreshing “shot” in between more demanding games.",
"In the Space Imperialist vs Alien war for your attention, Starship Troopers: Extermination brings a knife to a nuke fight. It’s a shooter you and some friends can find fun in, especially in its tough Horde mode using its simple-yet-distinct classes that help focus the overall large-scale bug-blasting vision. But you’re doing so in spite of how long it takes to unlock all the more interesting gear and abilities those classes have in store, how uncoordinated some of the multiplayer modes are, how downright bad the single-player campaign is, how barren the handful of available maps feel, and the lack of biodiversity in the bug swarm. It’s a serviceable battle that can get frantic in the thick of it, but there are far more noble causes to give your virtual lives for in 2024 than this.",
"Dungeons 4 doesn’t raise the bar for the dungeon-building subgenre, but it’s a delightful fantasy romp that harkens back to less complicated times, and that’s quite valuable on its own.",
"The storyline is too goofy to take seriously, with a cast that you can get behind on a surface level, but aren’t fleshed out enough to really hook you for a significant length of time. Still, the battle system is really fun to use and is so exciting that it’s worth playing through the game just to keep using it.",
"Neon White isn’t just a contender for the title of year’s best action game, but also a fascinating blend of genres, all mixed together to create a truly unique delight. The stellar level design, swift platforming and gunplay, and the terrific challenge in figuring out the optimal demon extermination route work together in harmony to make it a true heavenly delight, all set to a soundtrack that won’t be leaving the heads of players anytime soon. Neon White isn’t just a speedrunner’s delight, but a delight for any gamer in general, and it would be foolish to pass up something so sublime.",
"After all of the hype about the story, the Death Jr. comic book, and the upcoming film, one would think that the actual game would include a kick @$$ story, but that's just not the case.",
"It’s fun and humorous, if not a little short, and except for a few snags here and there when it comes to looking for items or trying to think up the next too-convoluted solution, it’s a fun game to play through to the end.",
"There’s a lot to appreciate about The Thaumaturge and that’s the stuff that will stick around. The weaknesses in the combat prevent some cool ideas from ever fully taking off. The rushed ending, whether the result of running out of time during development or an awkward playthrough, means the plot trips at the finishing line. But the uniqueness of the setting goes a long way toward making the game an interesting sell and the characters are fun to spend time with. So while far from perfect, there’s enough care in this project to make it a worthwhile visit.",
"PAC-MAN World Re-Pac is a fun 2D/3D platformer with creative level design, unique boss battles, and collectible items that are actually fun to find. From space ship battles to kart races, PAC-MAN World rarely sticks to one genre of play style for long and is all the better for it. While lack of camera control does make some sections more frustrating than necessary and the campaign clocking in at only five to six hours is a bit disappointing, there’s still a lot of fun to be had with this remake whether you’re a fan of the original or a newcomer.",
"If you like the NBA, if you are fond of basketball games, there are no alternatives, you will definitely play this game. But beyond being the only alternative to play, it also offers good reasons such as the Jordan Challenge and NBA Eras. It definitely deserves a chance.",
"With nothing truly new or original to be offered, many hardcore gamers may be put off, but if you're looking for light-hearted or semi-quick gaming sessions GTA: Advance is perfect.",
"Shadows: Awakening could use a longer power curve, or to dole out some more significant fights or abilities, to keep things from feeling stale. It’s the best possible version of what it is, but after a while, a lot of the shine wore off and it started feeling like a particularly violent part-time job. Still, if you’re looking for a new dungeon crawler, this is a pretty good one, and I did enjoy the first twelve hours or so.",
"Even with its issues, Foretales has been an entertaining ride, especially when it comes to the writing and the smart way in which cards are used during the non-combat sequences. The way the story expands and changes based on decisions means there is much replayability and more great writing to enjoy, and as long as you can avoid too much combat, Foretales has every reason to be a game to look out for when compared to contemporaries like Inscryption or Voice of Cards, or its real-life counterparts like Yu-Gi-Oh!.",
"Valkyria Revolution seems like an experiment to get new fans for the main franchise, although we don't think it's going to achieve it. It isn't a bad game, but it is far from the quality of the original trilogy.",
"It’s no doubt the most authentic. The biggest problem is how inaccessible it is. As a Brit who understands how the sport works, and who played Madden back in 2000, the game can still be a mind-bending, frustrating exercise in trial and error.",
"This puzzler, based on the classic brain strainer Rubik's Cube, is a collection of challenges divided into a series of minigames. It's simple but both fun and challenging and suitable for anyone with a desire to solve the cube. There are two extra modes where you can create music and build with blocks, but they don't add much to the experience. Nevertheless, if you're in the market for a brain strainer on the Wii this is a good bet.",
"I personally have nothing but good things to say about this game. In fact, the only problem I have is that it’s too short, and that just means I’m greedy. I think anyone who wants to be whisked away into a brightly colored land of adventure featuring the time-honored themes of good and evil, friends and foes, and a good dose of real humor will be doing themselves a serious favor by checking out this game.",
"At best, Romancing SaGa is an eight-part RPG miniseries contained in one overflowing DVD. At worst, it's an unbalanced snooze-fest whose surface you won't feel too compelled to scratch.",
The game remains true to the series in catering more toward the hardcore element despite good attempts at making the game accessible; Armored Core 4 easily offers up the hottest mech-on-mech action yet in this next generation.,
"If you haven't played a game in the series since the SNES however, Boston Lockdown is a decent starting point, and a perfect way to re-acclimate yourself to the genre with friends. If you prefer to fly solo, just go with Shadowrun Returns instead.",
"The Thaumaturge presents a fantastical look into history and allows players to take the wheel. With supernatural creatures, investigations spanning whole neighborhoods, and solid voice acting, there’s a lot to enjoy. It doesn’t get everything right, but it does provide enough depth and creativity to take the journey once or twice.",
"Under Siege is a real-time strategy game with many issues, although it is still able to entertain. Recommended only for those who want to enjoy at all costs a strategy game on console that takes advantage of Move.",
"It's quite telling that Ever Forward's demo (released independently with the subtitle Prologue) isn't that much shorter than an actual full play-through. Despite the title's tense stealth sections, and fairly involved puzzle-solving, the fact of the matter is that the final product plays out like the tutorial to a much longer adventure that never starts. By the time Maya's story starts to breathe, and the core gameplay begins introducing complex and layered puzzles, the journey is more or less over. The atmosphere is commendable, as are the puzzles actually present, but the is sure to leave genre veterans disappointed, and newcomers desperate for some meat to chew on.",
"Despite being clearly inspired by Limbo, Monochroma finds its own voice and uses it to say interesting things. Sadly, its level design lacks imagination and the mechanics are a bit rough, so you should consider buying it only if you really dig its style.",
"For their first 360 game, the raving rabbids deliver a mixed experience. The augmented reality enabling the rabbids to spawn in your living-room is fun, but lacks precision. The main issue resides within the fact that those levels do not constitue the majority of the game, more classic ones are, and they lack originality and rythm. The animated styled mini-games are funny, but we've already seen much better with a wiimote in hand in Wario Ware.",
"An absolute winner, and a must-buy for all Zelda fans. In fact, it’s a must-buy for every RPG or action-adventure loving 3DS owner, especially those who plan to upgrade to the New Nintendo 3DS on or after February 13th.",
"It's not as long as War for Cybertron, but it is more varied and more visually stimulating. Yet in leaving behind its predecessor's problems, it gained some of its own, sacrificing thrilling action in favor of noninteractive spectacle.",
"Being in development for such a long time, Dead Cells avoids the trap and lives up to its expectations. Nevertheless, only those brave enough to face its strong difficulty will be able to discover a deep and generous adventure. Despite a certain level of repetitiveness, even though the randomly generated levels still are hand-driven, Dead Cells' offers a brilliant artistic direction and a great but discreet soundtrack.",
"Knowledge is Power is a quirky, fun, bite-sized, quiz game show that utilizes nifty mechanics keeping the categories, questions, and competition entertaining. It’s visually pleasing with its charming cast of characters that surely a group of two to six people will enjoy.",
"Swing as it might between different genres and gameplay styles, Wrath Of The Dead Rabbit never dips below brilliant. An inventive and entertaining big-budget debut for Arkedo, and one that confirms its ability to deliver both on the indie scene and the main stage.",
"While DmC: Devil May Cry—Vergil's Downfall is exactly the kind of story-based DLC that I enjoy the most and getting a new slice of a fantastic game like DmC: Devil May Cry is always welcome, this add-on could have gone from ""okay"" to ""outstanding"" with just a little more work.",
"Crimsonland feels like an incomplete game. It has all the gameplay mechanics in place, but its backgrounds, character assets, music, and general presentation look and sound like they were put in for testing purposes while awaiting the real art and music to arrive. The twin-stick shooting at the core is fun, but the experience can’t help but be diminished by nearly every other aspect of the game.",
"Reality Fighters isn't the best fighting game ever made. It doesn't have deep controls and it isn't a big challenge for experienced gamers, but it has its personal approach to the genre, it's innovative and uses the PS Vita characteristics in some new ways. A good choice for users looking for something different.",
"Zen Pinball 3D is a tough game to recommend. For $7 you're going to get four tables that most franchise fans already own and have played to death. It would have been nice to have at least one 3DS-exclusive table to sweeten the pot, and I'm guessing that with dozens of other existing console tables ready to be ported there is no incentive to make anything original for the handheld at this time.",
"It's another Nintendo masterpiece with gorgeous and vibrant graphics, loads of original characters and enemies (both classic and new), beautiful and unique environments, classic Mario tunes, superb voice acting, amusing but challenging gameplay, engaging multiplayer action, and more.",
"If you can get past Iron Man’s head-scratching learning curve, what are you left with? A game that’s far from perfect, but still better than a lot of movie and comic book tie-ins that have come before ( *wink* Catwoman).",
"Interestingly, the senatorial concept has also been expanded to the barbarian tribes and other nations allowing you to more effectively subvert them to your cause. Assuming you're willing to get your hands dirty and do some assassination and smear campaigning, then you can sow seeds of malcontent far better than before.",
"The presentation won't blow anyone away, but the convenience of having the entire series on a single cartridge -- and one that, unlike the GBA versions, can be played on a DSi -- counts for a lot.",
"Evil Dead Regeneration is all in all a fun and funny game to play, definitely the best Evil Dead game to date, and even with the very apparent bugs and rather short game play time, there is only one word to describe this game. Groovy.",
"Rabbids: Alive & Kicking is definitely a unique approach to playing around with those mischievous critters. Much of the insanity and charm is back along with some new physical gameplay that might prove a bit too much for those, like myself, who come unprepared.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania retains the core appeal of the series: cute ball-encased monkeys rolling around devilishly challenging stages at high speeds. It ventures just far enough from the specifics of the original games to be considered a truly faithful remake, but those who aren’t intimately familiar with those games or are willing to adapt will find an amazing wealth of aggravating appeal and ridiculous stunts. It’s a great place to get acquainted with the series if you haven’t before, with plenty to offer veterans looking for something closer to the mark than the likes of Banana Blitz.",
"If you're worried about getting your $10 worth of gameplay out of Hotline, don't be. I would have paid at least twice the price for the game as is. With the promise of more levels, I can't see anyone being upset about the value of the game.",
"Even the youth market, at which it's aimed, should be able to clear enough of it to sate their Scooby urges in an overnight period, leaving parental wallets free for better gaming purchases.",
"Boring, repetitive gameplay, uninspired level design and pathetic voice-overs are just part of the reason why Iron Man is destined to become a video store rental rather than a full price purchase.",
"If there was a game to dethrone Halo 2 as multiplayer king, it'd be TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. This game's multiplayer is just incredibly fun, offering tons of variation as well as multiplayer bots to fit whatever your heart desires.",
"Many think that Majora's Mask is the best iteration in The Legend of Zelda franchise. These opinions are certainly not a coincidence, although constant chase after vanishing seconds, repeating the same steps multiple times and one weaker dungeon could be a distraction. The Original Majora's Mask was already excellent, but the new version is simply better.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is, for all intents and purposes, a phenomenal second act in the Remake series. Though it's open world design isn't perfect, the game is finely honed in every other area and provides as luxurious of an experience as FF VII Remake did.",
"A fun if slightly derivative third-person shooter. It certainly isn’t close to perfect -- the melee is kind of wonky and disappointingly underdeveloped, it suffers from a fair bit of repetition, and the enemy A.I. is only somewhat smarter than the girls on Flavor of Love. But the infected powers, the occasionally dazzling visuals, and Michael Rosenbaum’s sweet, sweet voice definitely make the game worth a look if you’re a fan of the genre.",
"Lumines Electronic Symphony doesn't fuss around with twists and turns with the core puzzling concept, sustaining that psychedelic synesthesia which sparks our continued adoration for the series.",
"Once Human combines simple but solid building and upgrading with some of the best, and weirdest, creature designs of the year to create a very enjoyable survival-crafting experience.",
"Röki pretends to be smarter - and more emotional - than it really is. As hard as it tries to impress and touch, it left me feeling as if I had eaten a plate of stale pickled herrings. Röki has gameplay and pacing issues but the biggest annoyance is that the lovable character you will play as has not been given any humanly worth beyond her obsessive mission. Maybe I take things too emotionally but overall, when reaching the unfortunately cliched ending after 14 hours of playing, I felt I could have spent that time better. While I enjoyed the game in parts and admired its enchanting look, it left a sour taste in my mouth.",
"Boring and afflicted by numerous bugs, Pixel Piracy could have been an engaging and enjoyable adventure. Unfortunately, the ideas end up too quickly and the crafting system reveals all its limits.",
"Despite the beautiful visuals and nuanced details, there's more tedium here than anything else. After a while, even die-hard RPG fans would be hard-pressed to enjoy the mindless sprints through the endless dungeons.",
"Truthfully, the entire game feels like a defiantly kickass celebration of music. Combined with the complete success and undeniable innovation of Pro Mode, how could anyone resist Rock Band 3?",
"This house-renovating simulator provides a satisfying sense of progression and realism. Its focus veers away from architectural and interior design, letting handiwork steal the spotlight.",
"Arkham Knight tells a mature story that cares about its characters. The missions are a little over-committed to showing how much the Batmobile can do, but it also feels like the car completes Rocksteady’s vision of a living, breathing Gotham City; a war zone with lots of problems to solve and lots of fun ways to solve them.",
"Crippled, but not useless. Even though its main story mode presents no challenge whatsoever - you can find that elsewhere - going through all the special moves was fun enough for the first little while.",
"Overall, A Space for the Unbound is a must play for those that enjoy getting an emotional experience from their games. The puzzles are generally easy to understand, and the game does a good job of making each space dive throughout the story feel different from the last in some meaningful way, helping gameplay not get stale as you go. It may take a tad longer than it should to get to the various emotional payoffs, but those moments are well done and generally worth it.",
"It's an average maiden voyage for the series on the PlayStation Move. When taken together as a whole package, however, the bad outweighs the good. It can be salvaged with a friend, but you have to cherry pick what to play to enjoy this title.",
"The Sexy Brutale is a lush, deliciously dark game that’s part murder mystery, part puzzle-adventure.Taken individually, the components of the gameplay in The Sexy Brutale are not groundbreaking: time reversal, stealth, and puzzle-solving are fun, but not innovative, elements. How they’re combined in this game, however, is fresh and unusual. The fantastic art and flawless execution of the game make this one must-have for fans of the genre.",
"Despite its essential linearity, Eternal Darkness leaves the player feeling like he/she has lived through a vast and sweeping tale, and is a milestone GameCube title any way you look at it.",
"Leaving home, getting married, moving to the city, coming home and finding out that your home isn’t the place it used to be—all of these are part and parcel of growing up. Sid, living on his own and with a published novel under his belt, might expect to be largely done with that process, but Forgotten Fields’ greatest insight is that growing up isn’t such a simple thing. It’s not a linear process with clear rites of passage; I’m not sure that it ever really was.",
"All in all, I like GRIP more as a concept than I do in practice. Rough and tumble racing is fine, but the combat is shaky and it’s far too easy to accidentally clip a piece of scenery and get launched into race-losing situations. It’s also downright strange that a game which promotes driving like mad also requires navigating each track like I’m walking on eggshells. GRIP should [be] bursting free of traditional racing constraints, but instead adheres to them more often than the ceilings.",
"Valkyria Revolution’s biggest crime is that it is utterly dull. The tonal changes to the narrative, and to the combat system, are completely pointless, and not only do a disservice to the Valkyria name, they render it meaningless. Such are the differences between the two titles I don’t understand why they bothered to sully the series’ fantastic reputation with this release.",
"It is hard to tell what the purpose of Judgment was, and how it would further increase the franchise's legacy. Yes, there is one interesting thing, but it is buried underneath a subpar game. It is hard to recommend this one.",
"Those Who Remain is a trivial story about corruption and injustice. Trying to seem like a horror game, it is not able to scare even a schoolboy. Pixel hunting and a weak story cause only disappointment. However, from a small company that has not released a single notable project before, it was hardly worth waiting for pleasant surprises.",
"The Incredibles will still be an adequate Christmas present to go with the branded action figures, books and random merchandise that children will be finding under their vastly over-decorated artificial trees, even if marginally more effort goes into making a Happy Meal.",
"The complexity of the game is very natural, which is a side-effect of the producers desire to make the game as real as possible. But despite this, the complexity of the game doesn’t seem forced or overwhelming for a minute.",
"Neon White is a video game vision executed with the kind of immense creativity and skill the industry needs more of. Intensely satisfying gameplay combines with a well-executed story, engaging characters and a crisp art style. Every facet compliments another area of the title with a serene cohesion which culminates in an adrenaline pumping, high-octane blockbuster of a game. Neon White is a very strong contender for my game of the year, and if you own a Switch or PC you owe it to yourself to experience this incredible title. Failure is common in Hell, but only through trial can you reach the salvation of Neon Heaven.",
"Especially boring was the fact that characters that die cannot be brought into the game immediately -- you have to go back to the nexus (that's not what it's called, but hey, it's my review) and get them, restarting the level again in its entirety. Ugh.",
"Fans of real life racing and previous incarnations of this title will be happy for sure, but the learning curve and lack of customization when it comes to upgrades may disappoint people who want more of an arcade feel.",
"Holding two entirely-knew Kingdom Hearts experiences and a criminally underplayed title in the franchise, Final Chapter Prologue is a collection that every likely Kingdom Hearts III player should experience.",
"It's minimalistic style and simple concept entertains us level after level. In all it s simplicity, BoxBoy's key characters surprises us with his charm. We would have liked the learning curve to be a little bit more steep.",
"Eleven years is a long time in between games, and the developers at EA Orlando largely did a good job. There's a lot of fun gameplay but there are some issues that will need fixing for the next version. Dynasty mode is the star of the show here with so much depth you might get overwhelmed. Here's hoping EA Orlando builds upon the success of this game and does even better next year.",
"With two different endings, Those Who Remain is worth playing through all the way at least once to find out how the story ends. But with so many issues, it’s hard to find the motivation to jump back in to reveal that second ending. There’s a small bit of horror and well-crafted atmosphere on offer, but it’s short lived – and there’s definitely better games to play in the genre. Maybe give it a miss, at least until the technical issues have been (hopefully) fixed.",
"Wuppo excels at being a solid and cute title. The presentation makes it seem like it was made for kids, but players of all ages will find it endearing. The musical score is enjoyable, and the game's quirkiness makes the story work. The gameplay, from boss fights to puzzles of varying types, works thanks to its simplicity and good pacing. This is definitely a labor of love from the two-man development team, and it is definitely recommended for gamers of all types.",
"Combat is the traditional RTS “smash into each other experience” but it works well (despite the questionable unit AI), and building your castle is incredibly pleasing despite the dodgy interaction with terrain. Irritating moments such as the enemy Lord fights and generally high difficulty detract significantly from the game, but it’s still an enjoyable romp for any RTS fan.",
"After a solid start, Minecraft Story Mode Episode 2 is disappointingly short. Coming in at around an hour in playtime, the adventure is brisk and active, but it ends right when you're getting into it. A lot happens, but the impact is dulled due to the breakneck pacing.",
"Even without the nostalgia creeping in, one can plainly see that this is a game for the ages. Cross-play would make this the perfect release for me, but even as is, I love this game.",
"Depth delivers thrills, making you feel like a dangerous hunter or a target. It's a nice change of pace from more traditional multiplayer games. It's only a shame that there's not more content.",
"The artists and developers did a great job of capturing the essence of a vast, empty mansion. Every room is well detailed with the flavor of a dusty, cobweb infested, untouched house.",
"Minecraft: Story Mode is a game made with love for the original series. The fans and the children are satisfied with the game. However, its a game that is too easy and too short for hardcore gamers, and the subtitles has a lot of problems for the spanish users.",
"If you're looking for an arcade racing game with an enormous amount of races, an awesome multiplayer, a lot of things to find and collect, and amazing graphics, you have finally found it!",
"A deep and profound strategic title wich fails to deliver, mainly due to a lame user interface, lack of tutorial, questionable AI, bad graphics and boring moments. The multiplayer fails to save it. It's definitely better to look elsewhere into the Paradox portfolio with better, more refined, titles as Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis.",
"It's getting a bit of a late start considering we're already more than halfway through the 2008 season, but MLB Power Pros is the best baseball game you'll find on the Wii. [Sept 2008, p.88]",
"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth breathes new life into one of the most revered games of all time. A vastly richer open world ensures your time in Gaia is thoroughly engrossing, while Cloud’s story is as gripping as it was in 1997.",
"The gameplay of Journey of a Roach is a bit on the short side, but that's to be expected of an indie title like this one. Sure, you'll finish the game in a few hours. Five, maybe six. But in that short period of time you'll have a blast. And that's why we think Koboldgames and Daedelic deserve a round of applause. We have a saying in Holland: 'klein maar fijn', and that's an accurate description of Journey of a Roach. It's relatively small, but great nonetheless!",
"MotoGP 08 could have been more than just a slightly shinier PS2 update, but it still does little to capture or validate the depth of motorcycle racing. It’s wholesome fun for aficionados, though.",
"With Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, struggling studio Don't Nod returns to its roots, offering loyal audiences everything they loved about Life is Strange. The slow-paced story may put off some action fans, but it builds to a powerful and shocking conclusion.",
"Either way, Final Fantasy XII is a fitting send-off for the series on the PS2, and it justifiably has a chance to proclaim itself the best Final Fantasy on the Playstation. [Nov. 2006, p.106]",
"Though the game offers four playable characters, there was only one instance I felt advantaged by my chosen character's skill. For the most part, each character feels just like the next, the biggest difference being the shift in dialog during cutscenes.",
"New Super Mario Bros. Wii is the latest in a long line of grade-A Nintendo side-scrolling platformers. Loads of warm nostalgia mixes with fresh level design to form the most fun you'll have with the Wii this year (and probably well into 2010, too).",
"Regardless of whether or not you enjoy the sound of a “top-down rogue-like deck & dungeon-building auto-battler”, Loop Hero will graciously guide you along its path - only to ensnare you in its devilishly addictive short gameplay loops.",
"A game with a severe identity crisis, clearly trying to appeal to the action-loving masses while attempting not to alienate fans of the slow-paced gameplay of yore. Problem is, it's unlikely to truly grip either group, and may well estrange many core fans. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]",
"Need for Speed Unbound marries classic NFS gameplay with a hot new graffiti-inspired aesthetic. Gameplay-wise, it’s a safe approach that sticks to what has always worked for NFS, with police playing a big part during races and open-world exploration. Thankfully, the visual shift does a lot to make this racer feel fresh, taking it in a different direction from the likes of Forza and Gran Turismo. Those looking for an arcade racer with some attitude should check out Unbound, as it wins far more than it loses, and looks great doing it.",
"With Arma 3, Bohemia made a big step towards a unified platform for its military shooters, but at the same time took two steps back in regards to actual game content. Only the most hardcore fans will enjoy Arma 3 in its current form.",
"Atari Flashback Classics may be missing some slices of the golden age of arcade history, but the licences and features it does have are enough to warrant a purchase for the casual collector. Despite there being a huge amount of games on offer, a lot of them are either copycat concoctions of more successful games which are still found here or multiple system ports of the same game. It’s also more of a collection for the old school fan to simply tinker through rather than to bang hours besting high scores and playing to completion. Either way, it does stand as a cheaper and more convenient alternative to Atari’s physical renditions found in your local gadget shop with the added benefit of quality emulation of true arcade classics.",
"Ghost Trick: Detective Fantasma is a great adventure game with a strong personality, an awsome look and pretty dialogs. The original gameplay is able to keep the interest constantly alive, but the lack of variety and the trial and error mechanics could be a problem for someone.",
"Everspace is pure addiction. It's an exciting space action game with the roots of a classic roguelike. You are alone in a cold and cruel space where you can die easily at the hands of powerful enemies, but you never will surrender. And this is one of the great achievements of Everspace.",
"If pinball play isn't your cup of tea, you may get bored or even frustrated before you get accomplished enough to unlock new tables. The bottom line is that if you are a fan of Metroid and even causally like to play pinball, you will become quickly addicted to aiding Samus in her quest to kick alien ass.",
Sin Episodes: Emergence is bland and repetitive yet frequently funny and sometimes entertaining game. The game remains start to finish a very standard first-person shooter albeit one with ragdoll physics and shiny explosions.,
"Sin Episodes is a great way to start off the episodic content experiment but, more importantly, it is a great game that is marred only by clipping errors and an invasive copy protection scheme. If Steam or the concept of episodic content does not hinder your enjoyment of a game, I would encourage all FPS fans to look into this.",
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! offers something for both young and adult players. The basic concept is simple and easy for everyone to grasp. However, over time, it presents a decent challenge, allowing you to choose more difficult levels that truly test your intellect, speed, and reflexes. It is a pleasant puzzle game that fills your leisure time well, with few shortcomings - occasional imbalance in difficulty, a lack of significant new features, annoying character voices, and some subpar sound effects.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is frustrating – not necessarily because it's really hard. By far, it’s at its best when it wavers in its dogged quest to imitate the Souls games, yielding a distinct combat system that truly stands on its own. Although its level design and story felt unfortunately esoteric at times, I still had tons of fun butting heads with Khazan’s challenging, tight combat. Thanks to its gripping, tactile fights and surprisingly flexible metagame, Neople has delivered on bringing a more action-focused spin on the otherwise well-worn formula that doles out punishment and satisfaction in a measured drip feed – when everything else is working as intended.",
"Anything that was good about Armies of Exigo is irreparably ruined by the woefully cliché story, simplicity, repetitive mission objectives and often dimwitted AI. I would have forgiven it all that, if only it hadn't been so boring.",
"The game's tutorial is excellent, and it slowly introduces you to some otherwise difficult concepts, but unless you have a lot of chords under your fingers beforehand, it takes actual practice to play on Pro Guitar.",
"It may not be saying much but Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is the best the series has been in almost two decades and newcomers are bound to find a lot to love. It wears its heart on its sleeve and clearly the team has true passion for the franchise. It's packed full of content, new ways to play and there are so many extras and improvements that never existed in the original. Unfortunately, the engine beneath it all isn't quite up to the job. What they've achieved with Unity simply isn't on par with the originals and while the main game is still enjoyable, many of the party games are severely hindered. Until Monkey Target returns to its former glory, we cannot truly say Super Monkey Ball is back.",
"The game seems to lack an overall level of polish, as you'll see some questionable AI and some occasional bouts of slowdown in the PS2 version of the game. Still, the gameplay itself is rock-solid.",
"There are definitely some good things to build and grow on for next year, but the overall package is too sparse. While much of the gameplay is great, the AI needs a tune-up. If you're looking for a football game expressly for multiplayer, give All-Pro Football 2K8 a chance. But if you're the type that wants a deep single-player experience, you'll want to pass up All-Pro.",
"Firefall is middling. If you have free time to spare, the fact that it won’t cost you anything to try is a huge win. If it manages to sink its teeth into you over the first few hours, you might just be hooked. Personally, I’ll pass.",
"Hunt the Night is a beautiful retro-inspired game with a haunting soundtrack and great controls. It is incredibly hard, so if you aren’t a fan of difficult games that have you challenging the same section, or boss for hours, this may not be a title you will enjoy.",
"As one of the highlights in the Nintendo Wii U software library to date, LEGO City Undercover blends together a large, compelling open world to explore with fun, suitably cheesy action sequences that can appeal to both young and old.",
"This is not the game that would have single-handedly saved THQ, but we're still lucky to be able to experience it now. Metro is quite unique in varying its pace, showing you its world and its inhabitants in between the action. All in all, this is an atmospheric, modern and utterly compelling journey.",
"Lock´s Quest is another marvellous example of the originality and creativity of a group of programmers. It´s a game that mixes RPG, strategy and action with simple ways and it´s very addictive. The way to prepare the battles is a wise move, with many options for the players. It is without a doubt one of the best strategy games for Nintendo DS.",
"What this game contains that is totally removed from everything else out there is a quirky, infectious, humorous character, one that seems to deeply reflect the personality of its makers. When you play it, you really sense a stamp of originality and zany flavor in its presentation and structure. [March 2005, p.48]",
"The Metronomicon is a good product, refined and polished. Rhythm game ethusiasts will probably love it but this is not for sure a game for everybody. The gameplay is neat and structured. The rpg elements add a strategic twist to the adventure, bringing innovation in a classic genre in which Puuba takes the opportunity to risk and succeed.",
"The Expanse: A Telltale Series - Episode 1 is a triumphant return for Telltale Games, as it delivers one of the studio's strongest single episodes alongside vastly improved mechanics and an intense introduction to The Expanse universe. The Expanse does an excellent job of engrossing fans new and old in both its source material and Telltale's trademark storytelling. While the impact of players' decisions in The Expanse has yet to be fully revealed, Episode 1 presents players with a greater sense of agency than ever before. By delivering a strong kick-off to Camina Drummer's origin story, and compelling evidence for the studio's return, The Expanse: A Telltale Series is shaping up to be one of Telltale's best experiences yet.",
"There's not much to like about SWAT: Target Liberty. The squad-based mechanic is imbalanced. The levelling-up and weapon selection systems don't have significant effects on how things play out. The plot is silly, the cut-scenes are rubbish and everything's so small it makes your eyes hurt.",
"Nod's stealth, the GDI's heavy tanks, and alien bugs all come together and blow up as a sort of mac-and-cheese RTS that tastes awesome in that safe, you've-been-here-before-a-hundred-times way.",
"As you run, jump, and dash your way through Neon White, you’ll not only find yourself comfortably falling into the natural rhythm of each platforming puzzle, you’ll also find yourself eager to replay stages and beat your previous score, or your friends’ scores, or both.",
"Hellbound has been in development for quite some time, and it's surprising to see that it has been polished so little since then. The main problem is that the game's shortages, paradoxically, are very easy to find in those games, from the golden age of shooters, that Hellbound is paying tribute to.",
"The gameplay is rewarding, the story twists and turns more than you'd expect from a game like this, and everything comes together to produce one of the best-looking, best-playing games on the PS2 so far.",
"There really just needed to be more of everything: more story, more to do, and more reasons to do it. With such a beautiful art style and such a unique character Beyond Eyes had a chance to be something really special but instead it just feels like walking past a beautiful painting, as it is over in the blink of an eye.",
"The calmer style of platforming in Super Princess Peach will not appeal to everyone, but for those that found Sonic too intense to play all the way through, this has a lot to offer.",
"If you&#146;ve already played Mario Party in any of its other incarnations, there&#146;s really nothing new for you here. The mini-games and boards may be different, but the game&#146;s the same.",
"This expansion successfully blends the fun of synergy through enhancements of the roguelite genre with the unique action of the Splatoon series. It does lack volume, and it doesn’t offer the player enough opportunities to show off the enhancements they made. The art and sound design are stellar as always, but its presentation falls short and the story is not much more than a sequel to the events of Splatoon 2’s Octo Expansion.",
"It's original, it's inexpensive and it's fun. Void is a perfect addition to the Bit.Trip series and is, arguably, the best of the batch so far, retaining the addictive charms of the previous two titles while carving out a strong and unique identity of its own.",
"It's great to see this iconic game series—one that introduced the term 'Commandos-like' to the gaming world—back in action after so many years. The fact that it preserves the traits of the characters we love and successfully blends the mechanics of the first two games is among its biggest strengths. However, there are so many minor and major bugs that they end up dragging down the overall experience. It definitely needs a few solid patches.",
"This addon offers new challenges for veterans as well as improvements for beginners. Actually it's optimizing the whole game, not changing a lot, just making it better and more fun.",
"The Forbidden Arts feels like a game from the early GameCube era, but not a particularly good one. Whilst the dungeons are vast and varied, and the platforming mechanics competent enough, the combat really brings the whole experience to its knees thanks to poor enemy AI and half baked elemental mechanics that make the entire experience feel very repetitive. Add to that the lacklustre graphics and empty overworld, and this is a game that only the most ardent of fantasy enthusiasts will enjoy.",
"[I]t's the Vita-specific features that may well entice new players to the otherwise hardcore fighting series. The lower difficulty settings actually let you dominate in fights on the easy setting (and there's 'very easy', too), unlike easy on Street Fighter IV, while a wholly touchscreen fighting mode lets you finger your enemies to death. It's not the best way to play the game, but it means that even the greenest newbie can win a fight without having to remember increasingly complex combat commands. [April 2012, p77]",
"Delivers on a unique cooperative experience that has you sneaking through levels as a member of a team of four burglars, with the right composition of classes. It won't be long before you'll get sucked into the charming atmosphere developer Pocketwatch Games established here. Alone, or with ill-intentioned players, it loses a lot of the charm and gets really hard during later parts of the game. Only play Monaco with accomplices.",
There's so much inside Age of Wonders 4 that it's hard to give a good overview in the space of this review. What's clear is that Age of Wonders 4 is a very solid 4X turn-based strategy game with so much customisation that the potential for replayability is nearly endless.,
"As weird as it sounds to mix brawling and bullet hell, Senko no Rondo 2 pulls it off. There are shortcomings but whoever is looking for a different approach to “duel” games, should give this beat-em-shmup a try.",
Doesn’t deviate much from Champions of Norrath—not nearly enough to be convincing as a true sequel. It carries the torch from the first game and is still just as fun as the original. Players expecting new advances in gameplay may be disappointed but don’t let that detract you.,
"[EM]-eNCHANT aRM- has a predictable, yet entertaining, plot featuring a small cast of likeable characters, a moderate sized world that will take about 40 hours to explore, and a good battle system. Sure the graphics are a mixed bag, music is strangely absent, and the encounter rate is high, yet it's still a nice start for next-gen rpgs. [JPN Import]",
Those who enjoyed Grasshopper’s previous work or are tired of repeatedly being spoon-fed the same game should check out Killer is Dead before it’s rightfully put on “most underrated game” lists in several years by the same people who criticize it now.,
"Hellboy may look better than ever clutching his Samaritan revolver, but Aussie developer Krome Studios’ riff on Mike Mignola’s comic series about a crime-sleuthing demon with a wrecking ball for a right hook feels like a couple of strung-together demo levels instead of a cohesive videogame.",
"What makes KH 2.8HD enjoyable more than most would expect is how it properly comes full circle with the story. Playing 1.5 and 2.5 leaves many questions that don't get answered until KH3D. This may come as a bit of a shock considering KH3D was a 3DS exclusive prior. Because of that, some fans haven't fully experienced what's out there for Sora and Riku's journey leading up to KH3. As a fan, this was a great way to start the New Year. As a gamer, watching a series like Kingdom Hearts evolve into what's included in this release is what we could hope for in other franchises.",
"It's a solid game with lots of good stuff...But its slow, repetitive pace keeps the thrills in check, and the bosses are either pitifully easy or painstakingly annoying. [Nov 2003, p.188]",
"Criterion has certainly made its mark with this latest entry in the Need for Speed series, injecting a bit more fun and polish into the template created by Ghost Games. The result is an arcade racer that truly stands out from the crowd thanks to its visual flair and thrilling police chases. Providing you take the time to tweak the handling to your preferences, and you don’t mind the hip hop-driven soundtrack, Need for Speed Unbound is likely to be the most entertaining racing game you’ll play this year.",
"The Roottrees Are Dead is a fascinating tale of a famous family with secrets in their closet. Exposing those secrets is some of the most fun I’ve had with a game in a long time, and anyone who has enjoyed similar investigative titles like Her Story, Return of the Obra Dinn, or The Case of the Golden Idol needs to look into the history of the Roottrees.",
"It's harder than most, but the feeling of elation when you finally work those punk-ass CPU roadsters into submission is legendary. Rockstar's latest above-the-law offering is excellent.",
"Paleo Pines is a largely successful execution of standard farming sim formulas and brings an interesting new (read: peaceful) interpretation to the monster-tamer genre. Collecting and caring for dinosaurs is the most compelling part of the game, almost to the detriment of other mechanics. As it stands, the game is a little unbalanced and could do with more effort put into the dinosaur-centric mechanics and less reverence placed on tying progression to arbitrary limits on player freedom.",
"Those Who Remain is a psychological horror experience completely lacking in scares and atmosphere. Its uninspired gameplay loop has already been done better time and time again, resulting in a dull, unnecessary title.",
"The first PS2 game to really get my heart racing. If you really get into this, your adrenal gland will start juicing out its stuff so much that you'll actually feel that buzz. [Apr 2003, p.82]",
"Even if we aren’t getting Kingdom Hearts 3 anytime soon, you’re finally able to play one of the series great titles at long last on the PS4, and see how the future of the series is shaping up.",
"But the real star of this 2 disc set is DOA 2 Ultimate, which takes a game that I thought blew away the competition back then, and gives it a hypershot in the arm. It has become by far the best in the DOA series.",
"Despite some difficulty balance issues Might & Magic Heroes VI is rich, full of missions, scenarios and maps. Definitely a good chapter of the M&M franchise that can be easily improved with a patch or two.",
"Batman: Arkham Knight is a nearly perfect ending of an excellent series. The package feels complete with its interesting fighting system and many gadgets. The Batmobile and the strong story make things fresh and new, even though fights with the Batmobile could have been better. We hope Rocksteady is not done with the Dark Knight yet.",
"Rapidly pressing the same buttons to slaughter similar looking bad guys eventually grows repetitive, and the game chugs when the bigger monsters hit the screen, but overall, you'll enjoy carving evildoers like lunch meat and battling familiar foes from the comic books and this week's film.",
"Through all the spinning, the fireworks, the lights and the board trails, the PS2 is just pushed a little bit too far...The toll appears in the form of a radically stuttering frame-rate which does slightly spoil the mood.",
"Don't expect an RPG of depth – it's heavy on the action, light on customisation, and rewarding loot is rare. It's also in desperate need of more time in the womb, and the results of that are felt all over. But by and large, the sense of location and the constant weft of combat meant that I spent much of the fifteen hours it took to complete in a state of gentle enjoyment – and that definitely counts for something.",
"Waking up bleary eyed the next day, our mouths taste like dry Toads and the room smells of Peach. But that won&#146;t stop us going to Mario&#146;s for another party, with so much to do if he threw a party every day of the week we still wouldn&#146;t get &#145;board&#146;.",
"You don't have to be a diehard Metroid fan to dig the onscreen action either, but being one will certainly help you recognize all of the little flourishes that only true Samus sympathizers will appreciate.",
"In its current state the game should have been a £1.99 PlayStation Mobile title, not a £7.99 PlayStation 4 game. The title is coming to PS Vita this week and will be cross-buy but not cross save, and is certainly more suited to short bursts of gaming on a bus.",
"Inspired by legendary RPGs and developers of yore, The Waylanders fails to honour them in any respect. Its story is as generic as they come, the characters completely inconsistent. The controls are clunky and some bugs prevent you from progressing. The combat system is fine, but that really cannot save this game from deserved oblivion.",
"Zombie Panic in Wonderland is a great game from the Spanish Akaoni Studios. A classical shooter with nice manganime style and a great visual value, nice story, and addictive playability. Sadly it is a little short, but we have the chance to play the game in cooperative with another friend. Actually, one of the best Wiiware games.",
"It still looks great, it’s still dripping with detail, and there are now even more rides to create and things to do. However, it still plays like it’s a piece of modding software, and not everyone’s going to enjoy it as a result.",
"Legrand Legacy is a polished game that has sadly taken a few controversial decissions, like the use of beautiful but complicated to navigate pre-rendered scenarios or QTE in combats that could may not be for everyone's taste. It should, however, please fans of the JRPG genre with its cliche but engaging plot and overall solid gameplay.",
"If Gripshift’s controls were anything resembling playable, the objectives were time-based instead of focused on collecting, and the game had a little bit of personality, Sidhe and Sony Online might have a sleeper hit on their hands.",
"It has the obsessive quality. This one goes beyond simple addiction. If you get into it, you will probably REALLY get into it, and want to want to redo the game until you&#146;ve completely dominated it.",
Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition comes packed with content even for the most ardent of Jurassic Park fans. Frontier has an eye for detail and although there's a small compromise in terms of total dinosaur population the payoff is a surprisingly smooth experience.,
"Crimsonland is exactly one video game: a perfectly competent twin-stick shooter, and nothing else. Unfortunately, the title’s quests feel a bit half-baked, and the whole thing could do with a facelift.",
"Mini-games are fun, but they often grow too old, too quickly; Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 is a clear example of this, but those looking for an easy-going multiplayer game might find some value here.",
"The Thaumaturge immerses players in a rich urban fantasy set in pre-World War I Warsaw, offering a blend of RPG and detective elements through the eyes of Wiktor Szulski, a mystic with the power to uncover hidden truths. With a story that weaves together political intrigue, historical figures like Grigori Rasputin, and supernatural themes, the game stands out for its detailed world-building and complex mechanics of puzzle-solving, stealth, and combat. Despite its deep narrative and unique gameplay, the game occasionally suffers from overly guided investigations and uneven combat pacing. However, its compelling setting and innovative use of Thaumaturgy ensure a captivating experience, even as some narrative and gameplay aspects feel underdeveloped.",
"As a fan of the rogue-like and monster catcher genres, Dicefolk is a treat. But while I love the design and enjoy the overall gameplay, the challenge could desperately use some retuning. But if you’re a glutton for punishment and don’t mind a ton of grinding, in that case, I can wholeheartedly recommend this challenging hybrid.",
"Not a terrible game, but it fails to capitalize on what it was trying to mimic. The controls are spot on, but the game is shallow. The characters are in abundance, but they all feel fairly similar.",
"Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series is a game build according to rules existing ever since The Walking Dead became a huge success. This six episode story is engrossing, offers lots of emotions and forces the player to make difficult choices but the illusion of non-linearity disappears during replays. And, of course, there is very little interactivity in this ""interactive series"" but fans of the genre, HBO's TV show and of George R.R. Martin's books should be happy.",
"Knights and Bikes presents a superb adventure that will definitely stick with you for a long time. You never want some games to end and in Knights and Bikes' case, the characters will make you never want to say goodbye. No matter where Nessa and Demelza go, I definitely want to follow along. Now, excuse me while I go hunt down every piece of merch for this game; I need all of it.",
Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is easily one of my top 5 games of 2010…so far. The level of energy and excitement and the wonder of what could possible come next kept me playing for hours on end.,
"Soldier of Fortune: Payback is a one-trick pony of blood and guts. And if that’s your thing, you might be able to overlook the generic shooting mechanic, enemy AI that’s cheap and stupid, and dull level design. But we just can’t.",
"The artists and developers did a great job of capturing the essence of a vast, empty mansion. Every room is well detailed with the flavor of a dusty, cobweb infested, untouched house.",
"Instead of setting its sights on liberty, the game should have perhaps concerned itself with offering a more engaging experience. Still, decent multiplayer and great graphics prevent this from being simply ordinary.",
"Spanning well over thirty hours with five different endings, there’s a great deal of fun to be had in the world of Ar nosurge. It’s just unfortunate that the lack of localization for the prequel ends up hurting the full enjoyment of this great sequel.",
"Like an NFL team’s high new draft pick, Madden NFL 25 provides the franchise hope for the future with its great on-field gameplay, phenomenal presentation improvements, and streamlined gameplay modes, as long as it irons out the predatory microtransactions in the meantime.",
"Zack & Wiki deserved much more success than it got, and it looks like there will never be a sequel to Capcom's underappreciated puzzler -- The Magic Obelisk, though, steps out of that game's shadow and shows that the same kind of thoughtful, character-focused puzzling is still alive and well on Wii.",
"The trouble is doing any sort of action requires using 3 or 4 menus, which is okay in itself, but in InuYasha: The Secret of the Cursed Mask, each menu takes twice as long as it needs to, dragging the battles horridly. Combined with a fairly high encounter rate, it seems to take forever to accomplish anything.",
"If it weren't for the somewhat unpolished enemy AI and placement, Ghost Recon 2 could have been a very realistic and engaging shooter. As it is, it feels a little out-of-kilter and more like a standard (but very good looking) shooter with some pacing issues.",
Boyfriend Dungeon is an extremely creative game that appeals to an unusual story that works in a surprising way. It has charismatic characters and gives the player complete freedom of choice. The downside is the low difficulty of combat and gameplay.,
"It can be fun for a bit, but considering you'll be done in two or three hours, I'd save your money and put this one on your Gamefly or spend a weekend with a free rental from the store.",
"Portal Pinball is definitely an excellent addition to the Zen Pinball 2 lineup, but that is based purely on its solid pinball mechanics and roots. The Portal aspect comes across as nothing more than cosmetic, which seems like a lost opportunity.",
"Had the additional DLC package been included with the game as standard, we’d probably suggest Klonoa Phantasy Reveries Series as a must-have for fans hungry to spend time with its cool cat protagonist again. It would be easier to recommend to newcomers, too. But as it is, while some will get plenty of enjoyment out of it at full price, most might want to wait until it goes on sale. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is an enjoyable blast from the past, but it’s by no means essential playing.",
"Once the faction-balancing issue has been sorted – something bound to be in place before the Xbox360 launch later in the year – well, this is likely to be the most popular Command & Conquer ever. And it’s all thanks to accessibility. [May 2007, p.100]",
"Only true flight-sim enthusiasts will appreciate with what you get for the price, but given how large the X-Plane community is, even the casual joystick pilot can find a fun and easily accessible experience despite its research and development roots.",
"South of Midnight is a fascinating journey into the magic of the Deep South, among beautiful scenery, strange characters and game mechanics that, while not inventing anything, are fun and engaging. The art department, both visual and audio, is phenomenal, while something could have been done to improve combat and the story pace, but it's nonetheless a game that all lovers of the action-adventure genre should try.",
"I love Rollerdrome. That “hell yeah” factor hit me early, especially once I saw how it utilized the foundation built by one of my favorite franchises, yet still managed to create its own experience. Its satisfying gunplay and sense of momentum make it one of the finest sports games available, while its art style makes it stand out from the crowd. Roll7’s winning streak of incredible skating games continues.",
"It’s a unique offering for 360 owners – as it would have been for Xbox – certainly, but one who’s highlights can’t match those of the RPGs currently burning brightly on PS2. [Apr 2006, p.87]",
"SingStar Ultimate Party is a step backward from the game it used to be. With the missing multiplayer-modes and no option to import old discs it looks like a kind of downgrade. If you don’t mind that, it’s exactly the game for you.",
"Some nasty, stale visuals for a GameCube game. Fuzzy, flat, funky--if Dark Legacy were food, you'd find it in a pub, on a Friday, because nobody had touched it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.",
"While Age of Empires was once the best game of its kind, the Definitive Edition’s changes are only superficial, ignoring the gameplay advancements that have improved the genre since 1997. As such, only existing fans will fully appreciate it.",
"The Limited Edition of Life is Strange doesn’t introduce anything new. The graphics are the same, as well as individual episodes that form this wonderful adventure. The art book and soundtrack are still a nice plus that could push some collectors to purchase this edition.",
What's so remarkable about B-17 is that it manages to be even more immersive for the player than even the most sophisticated dynamic-campaign-driven single-seater flight simulation.,
I’ve enjoyed playing Diablo 2 Resurrected and getting to experience the story in a visually updated way. The tweaks they made to get everything working on the console also helped a lot as it gave me far more flexibility in what abilities I had at my disposal. D2R is ideal for anyone who likes dungeon crawlers and doesn’t want everything to be explained or to be told where to go all of the time.,
"NBA 2K23 does a killer job of opening the floor to those that are new to the franchise, or those returning for their umpteenth time. With gorgeous visuals that help solidify this as one of the best-looking games of the generation so far, to controls that let you feel like a pro, there's very little to complain about here.",
"There were times when I really wished for direct 3D camera control instead of a multifunctional hand, but then there were times when the creative use of that right hand was so clever I forgot all about the camera.",
"Running, kicking, shooting, dying and doing that all over again: High Hell is one big chunk of action. Though the huge open levels sometimes work against it, High Hell is a fun and crazy arcade shooter to love.",
"Indeed, it's only once you've actually sat down and experienced every element that SSX3 has to offer that you can see how much more complete it feels against all the other snowboarding games that focus purely on one style of gameplay.",
"Two years has passed since Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2 has partly solved the problems that plagued the first attempt of Square Enix, with an interesting ""monster collecting"" part and a less linear gameplay. It's a shame that the story and character development are not as good as the original title.",
"With up to 50 hours of gameplay and the option of having rather straightfoward online battles, you’ll at least get your money’s worth; we’re just not sure that most Xbox 360 gamers have refined enough tastes to fully appreciate it.",
"Legrand Legacy is a great indie JRPG that brings a lot of cool ideas to the genre. While it has its quirks and definitely bad controls with the keyboard, the gorgeous visuals and gameplay make up for it tenfold.",
"A capable Dynasty Warriors clone but its lack of imagination when it comes to enemies, gameplay, and modes holds it back from being a great game. That being said, if you're looking for a mostly enjoyable action game with a colourful cast of fun-filled characters set in a quirky anime world then this is a game that you should definitely check out.",
"Forget about tactics: it's about pitting your silly custom character against someone else's silly custom character in a giggling orgy of button-bashing. It's not big or clever or deep, but it is fun if you take it for what it is.",
"If you're a fan of the original Assault Heroes game and you've been itching for more, Assault Heroes 2 is perfect for you. For everyone else, though, it's a tough call. The game adds a few new extras here and there, but it seems a little weak as far as sequels go.",
Offering a great atmosphere and impressive graphics The Last Story definitely is a great J-RPG. But the innovative fighting system often seduces the player to do button-mashing. With a completion time of around 30 hours it is quite short compared to many other RPGs.,
"A high price point and some subjective duds make Namco Museum a stretch in terms of outright value, but the influence these games had on the industry makes them worth at least a cursory glance in the rearview mirror.",
"The aesthetic design was pleasantly beautiful, the score was catchy and memorable without any dull moments, the characters were interesting and quirky, and the game stayed relatively simple without sacrificing any of my interest. There is a lot to love about The Sexy Brutale, but unfortunately, the game doesn’t take many big risks. Other than the unique hybrid between genre and mechanics, there seems to be a lot of wasted potential, or rather potential that could have benefitted from a little extra time and effort. I’m by no means disappointed, but I really would have liked to spend more time learning about the characters through something like additional puzzles or manipulation of the time mechanic. That being said, it does provide a great experience to anyone who is looking for a puzzle game with an interesting set of characters. It won’t blow you away, but it’s definitely well worth your hard earned twenty dollars.",
"There's certainly room for a tactical isometric shooter, but that game is going to have to be at least half as good as the high water mark set by Killzone: Liberation, and this game doesn't even come close.",
"So, the issues I had were just minor nuisances really. But the landscape is gorgeous despite the horrors that can be found within, the soundtrack is amazing, and the stories of those inhabitants that have survived, gives the wasteland and sense of hope. The main story quests are generally enjoyable and there was the feeling that they all had a purpose. There is still a grinding element to the side quests though, as you try and level up, but the goal of finding that treasure pushes you towards the end zone.",
"Madden 25 offers a really solid football package for those who missed previous entries. There are a lot of smart improvements to the running and defensive game, and the physics overhaul is noticeable. Madden 25 is a solid game with some much-needed mechanical improvements, but the modes feel largely the same as last year.",
"As the name says, Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition is the best way to play and enjoy this terrific JRPG. But beyond all the welcome changes and QOL improvements, it's impressive how a lot of the original elements (like the story or the combat) are as enjoyable in 2020 as they were in 2011. Monolith Soft truly saw the future.",
"Drome Racers' controls are frustratingly floaty, just as they were in Rollcage, and the cars themselves are even floatier, hovering several inches off the ground instead of maintaining contact with ""terra droma.""",
"I realise that it's financially unrealistic to expect a property as offbeat and niche as Hellboy to really benefit from ambitious game design, but that doesn't stop me from wishing that someone would let Blizzard loose on the character, for instance.",
"Madden NFL 10 goes on with the slow but steady progress of the EA franchise: despite this edition isn't full of big news, the game remains must buy for every Football lover, and thanks to the extensive tutorials it could attract people who are interested but not familiar with this sport.",
Activision is far too good of a publisher to unleash a game this poor onto the unsuspecting public. Fans of the series should skip this horrid excuse for a shooter and keep their glowing memories of previous Soldier of Fortune battles intact.,
"Overall, Zen Pinball 3D is a successful entry-level debut for the series on the 3DS. It contains few surprises and the re-use of old assets is disappointing, but such is the quality of the experience that these are easier to overlook.",
"This version is certainly a little easier on the eyes, but it never really gets the bat squarely on the ball with the gameplay that is delivered. As a Cubs fan say, maybe next year. [Jun 2006, p.115]",
"It has quality in some of its parts, and some dogfights are truly fun and exciting. Unfortunately there are some big problems: the challenge level of some missions is completely unbalanced, and technically the game has a lot of glaring flaws.",
"Clearly, Fool's Theory wanted to create a game that prioritized story, an uncluttered setting, and charismatic characters. And the studio succeeded. True, it is noticeable that they wanted a larger scope, but either there was not enough money or time. Closer to the end, even the animations seem very meager, and the endings seem chaotic. Overall, however, the team has succeeded in what they set out to do. With the success of The Thaumaturge, we can only hope they build on it and create the game of their dreams in their next outing.",
"South of Midnight proves itself to be a great new IP for Xbox and Compulsion Games’ best work yet. Despite some narrative-related issues and lukewarm combat, there is a lot to enjoy. If you have Xbox Game Pass, this is an absolute must-play. It exudes Southern charm throughout and doesn’t let up for a second. If this is the start of our journey with Hazel, then consider me seated and ready to go to Prospero again.",
Riptide offers what Dead Island’s fans were waiting for: a “more of the same” splatter-gory gameplay with some tiny additions... but not enough to give everyone else something to remember!,
"This interesting strategy-mix combines elements from turnbased classics, like Might & Magic: Heroes, King's Bounty, Disciples and Expeditions: Conquistador. Though the overall game-experience can be quite satisfying, there are some issues, that lowers the fun.",
"Calling is absolutely worthless. The acting is terrible, it controls poorly, and it's chock full of dumb cliches. It’s the videogame equivalent of the more recent Asian horror remakes.",
"Your enjoyment of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions will depend on how much you agree with Bobby Kotick's assessment of the previous entries in the series. If you truly believe they sucked, skip Shattered Dimensions as it's more of the same (just without the open world New York). But if you enjoyed them, you'll want to give the game a shot as it's another entertaining Spider-Adventure that's more linear than recent games in the series, but still a lot of fun.",
Fans of the original Fuzion Frenzy and other party games may want to give this a rent. Everyone else will probably take part in a contest to see who can return it to the game store the fastest.,
"Hydrophobia Prophecy is a challenging and original game that takes the use of water to a whole new level. Unfortunately there are some annoying downsides, like the over usage of cut scenes and the often terrible voice overs.",
"The quality of this year's edition is unparalleled, especially when it comes to the heaping amount of modes included (Race For the Heisman in itself is stellar) and the gameplay that EA Tiburon has been working on for years to perfect.",
"Trek to Yomi is, for me, just shy of a veritable masterpiece. Looking at it purely subjectively, I think this game is bloody brilliant, and certainly one of the finest non-AAA games I have played in a long time. Rich combat, striking visuals, a gritty narrative, and dynamic audio experiences blend together to make this game a true stand out of 2022 so far. Unfortunately, I feel the hyper-stylised tone and fixed Japanese language setting may prove a turn off for some and cause this game to be overlooked. However, if you have even a passing interest in Japanese culture, cinema, or just plain solid gameplay, then I implore you to give Trek to Yomi a look.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition takes a Wii RPG that was years ahead of its time and gives it new life and the visuals it deserved a decade ago. This is a must-play JRPG full of iconic characters, immersive environments, and addictive combat. There may be some minor technical and visual issues with this re-release, but they're outweighed by the brilliance of the new content and the inarguable timelessness of Xenoblade Chronicles.",
"Looks good occasionally, but is for the most parts an annoying street soccer experience. Stiff animations and a strangely behaving ball really take the fun out of football. [Mar 2006]",
"While RPG Maker Fes is not the best at what it does, it certainly is very capable in doing a lot despite of its disadvantages. It also serves as a learning tool to give users interested in game design. There is great potential for user-created content in RPG Maker Fes, but similar to many user-driven games, the quality of the games are entirely at the hands of the community.",
"The most important part about being a samurai in a videogame is to cut hordes of enemies into tiny, bloody little pieces. The fighting system requires you to use your brain and offer a solid foundation but the imperfect controls and small bugs keep this game from being great.",
"There are plenty of other games out there with more interesting puzzles and a more mature storyline. If your kids have a particular penchant for pests though, this might be a decent game to play with them.",
"Diablo 2: Resurrected is made for Diablo 2 veterans and is proud of it. Being one of those veterans, I can't predict how a modern audience will react to this idiosyncratic arpg, but I can say that in my eyes this is the perfect remaster (and not a remake). Hell has never felt like such a warm bath.",
"The latest DLC content delivered by THQ is nothing more than an approach to Space Marines. It's fun and compelling, but lacks any feature that's worth underlining. Buy it if you're a die-hard. Look away if you're looking for something different.",
"It’s certainly different from what we’ve come to expect out of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, but if you’re interested in a Nintendo themed puzzle game with some actual challenge, look no further than Minis on the Move.",
"Like a decent enough war movie then, it's something that you can sit and occupy yourself with on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but not something that's going to last for long as a truly memorable experience.",
"Its mixture of platformer and third-person shooter holds considerable potential, but unfortunately there isn’t a whole lot of gameplay development throughout the relatively short single-player campaign.",
"A game that has enjoyable moments to it, but suffers from a severe lack of detail. With little variety to the gameplay and no incentive to go through more than once, The Great Escape is a perfect rental.",
"Monochroma is a flawed but beautiful game that has a few shining moments, but for the most part struggles with the two most important aspects of a puzzle platformer: the puzzles and the platforming.",
"With a poor presentation and poor gameplay, War Times feels like an overpriced piece of budgetware that's destined to languish in bargain bins until its desiccated corpse turns to powder and is blown from our memory. [Aug 2004, p.82]",
"Despite its lack of cooperative or PVP gameplay, I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that this is an essential game for 2022. Blending two opposing styles into an expertly executed bullet ballet, Rollerdrome's future is anything but dystopian.",
"The Thaumaturge is a riveting mix of investigating gorgeous environments, weaving together narrative threads and battling through punchy, stylish turn-based combat. It’s a story where it feels like the choices do matter, and that makes decisions feel weighty as you progress through the twisted and memorable supernatural setting. Some of the investigations hold your hand a little too much, and it’s lacking some overall polish in some areas. Even so, The Thaumaturge absolutely nails the brief in every other way, making for a compelling RPG that stands on its own as unique, visually impressive and deliciously dark.",
"If you really can’t stand puzzle games like this, then Röki is not going to be what changes your mind… but I definitely encourage you to take a look at it. This one will use your time in a rewarding way. And I had a blast with it.",
"Hotline Miami is the rare breed of game that feels as smart as it is bloody. It is unabashedly gratuitous, but there's a context to its mayhem that escapes most ultra-violent operas. There's really nothing quite like it: its unique blend of tactics, tension and a cracked-out fiction bleed together to form a coherent experience that is equal parts cool and disturbing.",
"Ghost Trick is about problems and solutions, and while there's some fun in exploring the possibilities along the way, the game is only really concerned in wrapping you up in one memorable, start-to-finish run. Give it a chance to haunt you, and you won't be disappointed.",
"A very good RTS, you get to play missions with only a few troops and struggle against overwhelming odds and normally under equipped. This adds something to the title and makes this a title you can really sink your teeth into and spend hours trying to get your troops through each mission alive.",
"Huge pixels, old school top-down perspective, 8-bit animation and choice of colours convincingly recreate the mood of 1989 – the year Hotline Miami's story takes place in. Fortunately there's also plenty of excellent, unconventional and engaging fun for mature gamers. [CD-Action 13/2012, p.76]",
"The graphical and audio enhancements are phenomenal and huge selling points, but having a pretty game without responsive AI quickly makes those enhancements meaningless. The heart and soul of the game is there, even in the tutorial, but it’s simply too old.",
It takes a lot of guts to completely change the entire formula of a well established and beloved series such as this. The developers took on this monumental task and proved that it is a great chan[g]e of pace.,
"Immortals: Fenyx Rising - Myths of the Eastern Realm marks the return of the game back to the more open-world adventuring as opposed to the instanced puzzle-solving of A New God. However, the DLC does not manage to differentiate itself enough to stand tall. While visually stunning and delving into the rarely touched Chinese mythology, Myths of the Eastern Realm, the expansion feels much more subdued and even a bit unsure at times, especially when it comes to humor.",
"Concord isn't a bad game. It's a solid hero-shooter with appropriate gunplay and movement. With the right squad by your side, the 5v5-matches are solid fun. Yet again, Concord plays it very safe and doesn't stand out in any department against free-to-play-competitors like Valorant or Apex Legends.",
"While it may lack a certain technical finesse, Hotline Miami manages to take players down a road not many games do. It's as much fun to play through the game as it is edifying to reflect on what we've done, and for that, it is quite powerful.",
"It's a shame that Freedom isn't playable online, and there are a few awkward and unforgiving gameplay elements that hurt the overall experience, but determined hunters will find this quarry worth pursuing.",
"Yonder is as calming as it is addictive. I had thought I was happy with the amount I had played, only to come back the next day and complete even more quests. At just shy of $40 it's a little more than I'd want to pay for a game based around exploration, despite how wonderful the world being explored was. That hasn't stopped me from showing the island of Gemea off to all my friends though. Like a kid with the latest set of Pokémon cards, they're not really interested, but I'm going to make sure they know all about Yonder: The Charming and Calming.",
"The tongue-in-cheek tone of the game almost seems to mock you as much as it mocks the real life despots of the Cold War. If you can shrug that off, you'll find a decent little sim.",
"Combining clichéd gameplay with tired audio elements are plenty to overshadow any promise that the visual style of the game may bring. Just as the game's title character, John Constantine, this game is straddling the place between videogaming heaven and hell.",
The Lone Wolf mode is inspired and using technology that won't be in the field for another six years is pretty exciting. The camera gun will be your new favorite toy and Ghost Recon 2 may just become your favorite third-person shooter on Xbox.,
"It's hard to rate something like Black Book. It's a mix and match of things that are generally fun and refreshingly new, but the whole thing carries with it a lack of polish and balance, which could make this dark tale of witchcraft and demonology shine much brighter. This is basically a high 6, or a low 7. A mediocre, repetitive CCG/RPG, with some neat moments that'll - barely - manage to keep you interested. If looking to experience something outside of generic medieval fantasy, though, do give it a try. Morteshka's creation is basically Slavic Pagan Mythology: The Game.",
"Neon White is a love letter to turn-of-the-decade internet weirdos. It's full of rule-of-cool anime nostalgia, ear-shredding electronic music, and dialogue ripped straight out of my group chats. It's a genuine game made for an audience rarely prioritised, but even if you don't fit the archetypical person this game was made for, you're still in for the most stylish and satisfying action-platformer I've ever experienced.",
"Those seeking the goofy humor and weird puzzles you wax nostalgic about, Insecticide could possibly scratch your adventuring itch. Just be prepared to split that 50/50 with ho-hum action sequences.",
"A fun little card game, and it holds up well on the GBA. It was a little hard to adjust to since I'm not an avid Yu-Gi-Oh player, but once I got the hang of it, I did find myself enjoying the game quite a bit.",
"It's a shame that Metal Saga's high points -- the humor, the music, and its relative freedom -- are mired in disappointing production values and a concept that hasn't improved since the series' 8- and 16-bit days. It's droll and ""different"" -- but it's so different, it's the same.",
"As gameplay goes, Knowledge is Power is, for the most part, fun. I think the game moves just a little slow in between rounds, as I found myself trying to skip dialogue and get us into the next question quickly, but the animation and the way you can really screw with opponents is clever, as are the variety of questions given. The price tag isn’t bad either, as the game comes in at $19.99, certainly a price worth paying for some good trivia. I would play this game at home with the kids/wife, and I intend to do so during the holiday break, so it does have some longevity to it. All in all, though, and at least in my opinion, this game does a good job of bringing back memories of 3DO’s Twisted, which I consider the best trivia game to date. I know people want to crown You Don’t Know Jack, but Twisted for me.",
"Namco Museum is only really worth purchasing if you either have an unhealthy obsession with at least three of Namco’s arcade classics, or want an immensely fun party game and don’t care too much about the price or extras. It’s great to see that they won’t be forgotten, but aside from Sky Kid there were no games that I hadn’t already played that I liked. Namco Museum is certainly well put together and presented, but the selection of games just aren’t completely enticing.",
"EA Sports FC 25 confirms the solidity of Electronic Arts' modern gaming and content proposal, in a chapter that is starting to show signs of a long-desired revolution. The main game modes do not offer any particular innovations, but are still more integrated with each other thanks to a unified progression system and Rush, which acts as a minimum common denominator integrating equally between Career, Ultimate Team and Club. Volta's replacement is in fact more effective and focused than its predecessor, although in cooperative matches it turns out to be quite confusing and frenetic. In any case, the substantial difference this year is in the gameplay, which maximizes the technological achievements obtained thanks to HypermotionV, FC IQ and Cranium for a more realistic, immersive and engaging digital football experience than ever before: finally, thanks above all to the improvement of Team Tactics and Player Roles, FC 25 embraces a more strategic idea of football and less focused on full-throttle speed. Another small and significant step forward towards the definitive leap in quality.",
Trek to Yomi's excellent visual quality and sound production are enough for you to recall classic black-and-white films. But maybe they put too much effort into the visual side. Gameplay itself feels so plain and simple. The fast-paced combats are interesting in itself but barely changes. And the collectables are not attractive enough.,
"It may seem a bad clone of Gunpoint, but it's not, it's way more focused on the fighting aspect, and uses it's mechanics in pretty interesting ways. The lack of variety is basically its main problem, but it remains a decent game.",
"Since the game’s storyline and restricted gameplay keeps you from ever just branching off and doing your own thing, what you’re left with here is basically a sub-par pirate-themed adventure game that offers some fun sea-based combat and some boring sword-to-sword stuff.",
"If you're looking for a pure sim with plenty of extras, plunk down the cash for ""Madden."" If you're looking to smash it up with your buds over Xbox Live, then NFL 2K3 is your best bet this year. [Fall 2002, p.106]",
"The biggest problem with Grand Theft Auto Advance is that the game is so big and there is no in-game map to be found. There is the typical radar which has your mission points, but you won't be able to know where the hospital is, for example.",
"The lacking depth of the mini-game designs and limited exploration aspects could be counted as a negative against The Deadly Secret, but are more likely to just make the adventure more accessible for young female gamers being newly introduced to the adventure genre.",
"In the end, Guardian Heroes, despite showing signs of age in the graphics department, plays just as well as it did back in 1996. More of a brawler with RPG elements than an RPG, it provides quick and fun entertainment, with plenty of features to encourage many rounds of replay. With the addition of online play for the story and versus modes, the multi-player elements of the game can finally show their worth. The remix mode provides updates to the original gameplay, meaning that those both new and old to Guardian Heroes will find plenty to love.",
"Even with combos and grinds at your disposal, the jumps and turns come so fast and thick that intelligently managing the course is a huge necessity...The game feels far less like a dog and pony show as a result, and is more challenging and rewarding, too.",
"Signature company staples -- hordes of enemies, screens filled to bursting with explosive sprites, and a fiendish difficulty setting -- underscore a stunning, bite-sized seven-episode morsel.",
"New Star GP captures the intense racing action of an F1 season, from on track action and pit strategy to building your team, but does so without losing any of the fun of an arcade racer.",
"Mafia contains none of the features which make a game next-gen on the Xbox. There is no online, multiplayer, or system link play. The game is brought to us by a two year old pc game so it is safe to say that the graphics have been seen before.",
"Sakaguchi's latest is not a tribute to JRPGs of old, as many might have expected, but a bold new step for the genre. Although it's quite short and suffers from many cliches, Last Story is, without a doubt, one of the best games Japan has to offer in this generation.",
"There's still a disconnect between what happens during gameplay and what happens during cutscenes, but by integrating the combat and exploration, Final Fantasy has come one step closer to being more immersive than before.",
"A fun and challenging puzzle game that is best played co-op. If you are on your own, racing against the timer and trying to move heavy blocks around can become quite hard and get frustrating.",
"Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a fun, simple blast-a-thon that goes a little beyond typical twin-stick shooter mechanics with its classes and upgrade system and it takes place in one of the coolest settings in all of gaming.",
"Although Square has clearly found the limits of the PS2, Final Fantasy's new, seamless approach to exploration and combat works beautifully, and comes with all the depth of plot, character, and gameplay that we've come to expect from the name.",
"Considering that Insane's graphics are fantastic and it has enough gameplay diversity in its numerous modes to keep people playing for hours on end, it's disappointing that the one of the most basic features of a racing game, its control, ultimately drags the game into the mud.",
"Tough, punishing and as unreliable as the timer on a second hand VCR, there’s an experience hidden beneath the lush foliage and 100 different types of weapons that’s hopefully the first of many to revolutionise the RTS.",
"The visuals are absolutely stunning, there are dozens of things to unlock (including some things that were not originally in DOA2) and the online play has been implemented flawlessly, giving us, for the first time, an online 3D fighter that actually feels like a group of players at an arcade and even includes tournaments and championships.",
The multiplayer options and new battle additions make Strikeforce better than other Dynasty Warriors games. Perhaps Strikeforce 2 (we're sure Koei's already working on it) will be the ultimate battle game.,
"You wonder if players will have wanted to spend this amount of time loafing around the Homestar Runner universe, or whether their interaction with it is best limited to ten-minute bursts via their web browser. [Oct 2008, p.101]",
"I kept thinking that Fallen Legion was a much more expensive game with just how it looked and sounded. The art and music are standouts, despite their modesty. Everything else would have greatly benefited from more polish, but there is great potential in these games. I cannot wait to see what the developers make next.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is what Final Fantasy XIII should have been, with lots of sub-quests, mini-games and a little more exploration. Despite responding to fanbase requests, the team left unaltered the fighting system and the linearity; so this is not the comeback of a classic Final Fantasy.",
"In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a lot of what was wrong with Final Fantasy XIII has been repaired and improved upon. Everything is not perfect - the soundtrack, loading times and animations could use some more work, but overall Final Fantasy XIII-2 shows that Square Enix still knows how to make great games.",
"There are two really solid games in this package, and Razing Storm has a couple fun modes. Compared to most light gun games you'll find lots of great content here. This is a better value than any other recent light gun shooter release.",
A study in bad design and boring gameplay... Heed my stern warning and don't talk to Ephemeral Fantasia. Don't pass her notes. Don't try to get test answers off of her. She's an evil witch.,
"As long as players know what they’re getting into With Neon White, chances are they’ll have a brilliant time. It’s got a clean visual style, a brilliant soundtrack, and gameplay that’s challenging but moreish. Add in a story that will keep you interested in uncovering the fate of Neon White and his acquaintances, and you have one of the most interesting releases of the year so far.",
"Franchise fans and simulation junkies alike can rejoice at Jurassic Park Evolution: Complete Edition’s move to Switch, save for the visual quality, which took a noticeable hit. Three expansions full of intrigue, Challenge mode, and Sandbox ensure endless replayability.",
"Difficulty spikes and a wonky camera will occasionally have players throwing their controllers across the room. Still, this otherwise compelling remastered package demonstrates why Sega needs to make Super Monkey Ball one of its premier franchises.",
"Four months is a long time to wait for a game – especially when you’ve just picked up a new console with nothing else to play – but the wait was worth it. Just like the all-ages appeal of LEGO bricks and sets, LEGO City Undercover effortlessly rises above its station, representing the culmination of every LEGO game that came before it.",
"Life is Strange is not perfect, but it has a soul, and that's something quite rare those days. If you like this new Telltale-like adventure genre, Life is Strange is one of those games you don't want to miss.",
"With great new moves, excellent graphics, plenty of deep, exciting modes including a variety of mini-games, NCAA Football 06 comes highly recommended. If you passed on last year's game this is definitely the year to buy.",
"It's hard for me to put a precise score on that kind of thing. I'd be happy to recommend it to anyone with a card-game addiction, it's got a few things going for it as far as being an RPG, and if you're interested in learning about Russian mythology, Black Book is practically an educational tool. However, it's also janky, inconsistent, and not great about explaining its systems. I wouldn't say that it's exactly unpolished — I get the feeling that Black Book is exactly what it was intended to be — but it feels like the sort of game that, back in the day, would've shipped with an inch-thick manual, which you don't have.",
"The looks of Trek to Yomi certainly offer a nice homage to the 50s Japanese cinema. Alas, its gameplay is disappointingly simplistic from the non-existent platforming to the utterly repetitive action.",
"Dirty Bomb is a nice shooter that is a perfect F2P alternative to a lot of the major FPS titles out today. The game is still in beta however, so there are a lot of features to be added and a lot of flaws to buff out. Hope that the devs can fix what needs to be fixed and polish this game to fulfill the potential it shows.",
"Although it fails to provide any real competition to the bigger action titles out there, Wolverine is fast, fun, and definitely angled at fans of the comics. It might not have the longevity required to be considered epic, but if you can ignore the repetitive nature of the combat you'll have a blast.",
"Unbounded may not have much to do with the things that defined Ridge Racer, but if you can get over that, you'll discover an energetic, entertaining racer, with gratifyingly destructive environments, challenging gameplay and interesting online. Ridge Racer was due for a reboot, and here it is.",
"Just like its predecessors, BfME is probably the most fun RTS at the moment. I liked the Witch-King campaign, but the new and improved War of the Ring still feels like a war of randomly moving chess pieces. [Dec 2006]",
"EA FC 25 might not be the giant leap forward that many fans were hoping for, but its best-in-class visuals and realistic matches still comfortably make it the best football sim on the market. While it’s disappointing that some of its biggest and best additions haven’t been fully capitalized on, it still sets a strong foundation for EA SPORTS to build on in the coming years.",
"Even though it is a step forward from the previous episode, there are still some AI-related issues that need to be fixed. Apart from that, the lack of campaign mode –so far, it'll be added as free DLCs later– makes it a platform where, at the moment, we can only enjoy the community creations.",
"Kick and Fennick is easily one of the most exciting new IP's to hit PlayStation Vita, and as Jaywalkers Interactive's first release, is a very impressive effort. Be sure to pick this up and play it, you won't be disappointed!",
"Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE Plus delivers a reasonable collection of mysteries, but not on the level that such a competent team could've delivered after so many years developing a new franchise.",
"Kingdom Hearts 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is a morsel that updates a small bit of the past with a very nice Dream Drop Distance HD Remaster, details a bit of the present with the χ Back Cover cinematic, and shows a smidge of the glorious future with Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage. The gaming content is high quality, but low quantity, leaving you wanting more. Great for junkies needing a Kingdom Hearts bump to get them through the long wait should get this immediately.",
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is an excellent opportunity for more players to get to know the saga. Despite the years, its gameplay is very entertaining, even if the fun factor might be short-lived due to their short stories.",
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms feels like an incredibly nostalgia-driven game, aimed specifically at those who hold classic beat-’em-ups, the River City games in particular, close to their hearts. And for that audience, I think they’ll be very satisfied with what River City Saga has to offer. For people like me, who have less nostalgia for the franchise, they may struggle to understand the repetitive nature and overall appeal of River City Saga: Three Kingdoms.",
"Röki is challenging and captivating during each moment of gameplay. The narrative flows naturally alongside the puzzles, and the world acts as a beautiful set-piece that begs to be explored. Direction and backtracking can bring the pacing down a bit in the later parts, but the conclusion makes every obstacle worth it.",
"Tropico 3 has all the depth you could want, but presents itself in a fresh light that emphasizes fun without coddling the player. If you have any interest in playing out a dictatorship fantasy, this is as good as it gets.",
"It is a nice surprise, particularly if you can get it for free with PS Plus. It delivers some fun, based on some original mechanics, and we think that, if you're a PS Plus user, it deserves a try.",
"Although the idea is good and there is a lot of content and options, the core of a fighting game isn’t here. The combat is very simple and chaotic, the roster isn’t balanced and the AI is extremely poor. Without online functionality, we can only recommend it to play with friends.",
"After a fourth chapter that has pushed the boundaries of the series to another level of exploration and complexity, returning to Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD seems like a step back on the route of evolution. Anyway, Ubisoft has done very good work with the HD adaptation and if you wish to know something more about the Creed's universe and this charming character, the ticket to the 700's New Orleans is not too expensive.",
"If you already have the previous one, you really don't need this Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate. There is not enough new features and content to justify the opening of your wallet. However, huge fans, wealthy players and new challengers would probably try the five new characters and levels, as well as the Power Blow.",
Sonic Colors is a dizzying combination of the distantly familiar memories of the first few Sonic titles combined with thoughtful new abilities and mostly well executed level design.,
"Overall, Bandai Namco Entertainment’s Namco Museum for the Nintendo Switch is a well thought through collection that touches the older gamers’ heartstrings and those 90s/2000s gamers who believe they grew up in the best video game times. In other words, it’s got a bit of everything, nearly all good, for every type of gamer out there. It’s a welcomed addition to the Nintendo Switch.",
"With a series of meaningful improvements that culminate in a more interestingly designed campaign and sustainable multiplayer experience, Fall of Cybertron continues the franchise's upward trend in quality with a sequel that's definitely worth attention.",
"A very good product. The difference between this game and Firefly's previous game is devastating. Crusader II is basically Crusader wearing Stronghold 3, and that's not a bad thing. To be honest, the campaign could have been better, the interface clearer and the graphics prettier, but all in all the end result is worthy of praise from the fans.",
"Most disappointing is that unlike previous Rabbids games, most of the mini-games just aren't fun without multiple players. And even with them, bland activities aren't always enjoyable. With no basic story to hold everything together, anyone besides Rabbids fans will have no motivation to keep going.",
"There's plenty of customisation available to keep it fresh and the inclusion of AI opponents and a challenge mode will give this more longevity than other couch co-op titles released recently. However, some will find the controls frustrating and it is likely that the frantic madness of multiplayer will have a limited shelf life once the initial surprise of the silliness wears off.",
"Röki is a brilliant and emotional adventure that will appeal to all lovers of adventure games and well-told stories in general. The mature themes are handled in such a wonderfully appropriate way that it would make a perfect family game, and I loved the time I spent with Tove. Rather than a flatpack indentikit product, this is a game that has all the hallmarks of true artisanal craft and skill.",
"The gameplay of Puzzle Bobble never gets old, and in Everybubble it’s no different. Popping bubbles is just as much fun as it was in the 1990s: almost 30 years later, and it’s as enjoyable as ever. Puzzle Bobble Everybubble offers up a well-rounded package with plenty of modes to jump into, with Baron’s Tower and the joyous Space Invaders twist giving players reason to keep jumping back in long after the story mode has been completed. What’s not to like, really?",
"Outside of a minigame or two, it just isn&#146;t fun. The single-player story mode is uninspired and poorly executed, and the online component suffers from a serious lack of competition and more-than-occasional lag.",
"The multiplayer is amazing, and the single-player can be very rewarding if you're willing to go the extra mile, and you have to be willing to spend a lot of time perfecting your skills.",
"Arma III’s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once you’re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, you’re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that’s simply not offered elsewhere.",
"In the end, playing .hack//G.U. Vol. 1//Rebirth is like drinking fine wine from a plastic sippy cup. It has a compelling story and premise, served up with repetitive dungeons and stale battles.",
"Science Of Evil sits comfortably among the worst games we’ve played this generation. It’s so mind-numbing and monotonous that if you’re not careful, you can almost zone out entirely white playing it and not take in how amazingly poor it is in every single respect– you’ll come to several minutes later to find you’re still tapping the X button (Square on PS3, unless you love jumping), still winning and the top and bottom corners of your telly will have melted to make it look a bit like a sad face. Okay, so the last one didn’t actually happen to us, but at least it would have made things vaguely interesting.",
"Time with Grip follows a predictable slope. It’s amazing that a team dedicated years of their lives to recreating Rollcage in 2018. It’s surprising how good it looks and how effectively it replicates Rollcage’s take on arcade racing. It’s exciting that it contains a massive campaign with a bunch of different race styles. At the end, it’s distressing that Grip can’t maintain an engaging tone across its time with the player. Without addressing twenty year-old problems, it’s difficult to make a modern commitment.",
"If you're of age, buy Hotline Miami. It's a great, emotionally heavy game with superb mechanics. It's a bit expensive and offers only a few hour of fun, but it's worth the price for the opportunity to ponder on man's nature. I wouldn't mind, if it was longer. You could appreciate simple, old school graphics, an excellent soundtrack and unique gameplay more. Still - the game's great!",
"What really stands out however is the career mode which is loaded with possibilities. In addition to RPG elements like leveling up, there are plenty of cars and tracks to conquer and an inordinate amount of upgrading to be done both cosmetic and functional.",
"Need For Speed Unbound delivers everything fans of the series will want, with a cool new art style too. But due to some woeful voice acting and a lack of spectacle, it fails to deliver on the aesthetic it hoped to achieve.",
"Neon White is a combination of genres that probably shouldn’t work, yet I had a fantastic time playing. Each stage tests your platforming skills, and new cards keep traversal fresh. The speed and level design are impeccable, but I couldn’t help but feel burnt out after multiple replays in some areas. Regardless, the character writing grounds you in this unique space and urges you to complete every optional mission to unlock everything this game offers.",
"The opponent A.I is excellent (with a few occasional exceptions) and everything from the handling and physics, the customisation options and the racing is presented in a superb manner.",
"Thanks to some small improvements, the dungeon building part is the best in the series, but aside from that, its pretty much the same experience as in Dungeons 3. Which means the overworld with its RTS-styled combat still feels undercooked and is lacking some real improvements. It's fun (if you can stomach the horrible writing), but it plays more like a big expansion rather than a true sequel.",
"Age of Wonders 4 is a deep and addictive turn-based strategy game that offers excellent player choice with custom worlds and varied rulers, alongside tweaks to the proven formula. Only its technical blemishes cast a dark shadow over the glorious realms found within.",
"Beyond Net play, 2K3 simply can't be ignored for the new depth within its Franchise mode and the series' evolving commitment to football that smacks you upside the head. [Sept 2002, p.89]",
"Forza Horizon 5 takes an already-amazing series and makes it better with a grander scale, but also an increase in quality. Even in its earliest days, it’s clear that the game will have a longer shelf life than prior entries thanks to the revamping of user-generated content adding more kinds of gameplay to the mix. Having things like obstacle courses thrown in helps evoke a bit of Project Gotham Racing, while the increase in NPCs and overall world-building makes for a better overall experience. Forza Horizon 5 is a more back-to-basics game in the sense that it puts the player on an ascendable ladder and doesn’t feel aimless like the prior two games – which in hindsight, were a bit unwieldy with regards to giving the player a set path to actually enjoy its many offerings. Forza Horizon 5 is the best entry in the series yet and should only get better as time goes on and more content is added.",
"Klonoa is stuck in classic-game-port limbo -- not given enough shine to stack up against other remasters, and not quite zesty enough to hold up to modern titles. Still, a helping of nostalgia or appreciation for classic games makes these two otherwise great titles worthy of a playthrough.",
"At a full $60, there's absolutely no reason to touch this with a ten-foot-pole, especially with so many other, better shooters on the market in this record-settingly awesome holiday season. [Jan 2008, p.62]",
"The improved single-player experience, the enhanced and multitude of online modes for all skill levels and Salmon Run which is just a ton of fun make Splatoon 2 the complete Switch game. The game’s style and charm are terrific and it runs at an amazing 1080p 60fps rock solid the entire time. With a year or more of updates promised and regular Splatfests planned, Splatoon 2 will among your most played games for a while to come.",
"While a few of the gameplay portions in the middle dragged a bit too much, A Space for the Unbound is one of the best narrative driven indie games I’ve played. Despite not having been to Indonesia which inspires the setting, the storytelling, characters, and atmosphere all felt perfect. It reminded me of how I felt playing The Kids We Were and Persona 4 Golden in that sense. If you enjoy memorable stories and great characters, A Space for the Unbound is an easy recommendation on Nintendo Switch.",
"All-Pro is still playing at a collegiate level; while not bad in multiplayer online, there’s simply no depth for the single player who is looking to carry a franchise through to greatness over several seasons; that feature’s just completely MIA.",
"While Parallel Lines is a decent offering, it feels very much like a watered-down Grand Theft Auto, with a more linear storyline and fewer random fun things to do outside of missions.",
"As a game, MLB 2K6 feels more than competent, but it fails to excel. Much like last year’s Cubs, it has its shining moments, but in the end you’re left with the distinct feeling that it could have been so much more.",
"Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a great addition to the recently strong lineup of 3DS titles out there. As a downloadable title, it's extremely accessible and at only $9.99, it's also extremely affordable. Considering this game has all the meat of a regularly priced title at a quarter of the price, it would be hard for any puzzle fan to pass this title up.",
"While Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition doesn't entirely look like a new game, with remnants of Wii design clear to see, everything else about it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with modern JRPGs. Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition has an explosive story, mesmerizing worlds, dramatic cutscenes, and a lot of heart. If you're a JRPG fan and you haven't played Xenoblade Chronicles yet, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.",
"If you&#146;ve played ""Final Fantasy Adventure"" and were looking to have as great of an experience with this game, you might be a little let down. Thankfully, Sword of Mana does not continue the downward slide that the Mana series seems to be suffering from in recent installments.",
"Knowledge is Power? No. A kick to the groin of the winning player is power! This is a pretty standard quiz game, but those always make you pumped up for a round of trivia and friendly curses. So, gather your friends and play a game or two. If you have any friends left, that is, after your winning streak, Mr Know-it- all.",
"A gem only for Gust's franchise fans. It's technical characteristics are far away from what you would expect of PS3. However, the universe in which it's englobed will give the player quite some enjoyable moments.",
Definitely one for fans of humorous graphic adventures. It pays homage to the LucasArts classics and you will find references to familiar situations and characters that no doubt inspired the making of this game. Even if you miss the references you will still have a thoroughly good time.,
"It's easily one of the better titles on the system. If you've any love for electronic music then the soundtrack alone is probably worth it, but as a puzzler there simply isn't anything else around that even comes close. Essential day one stuff.",
"The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human has a neat concept, good presentation and clever boss fights, but nearly nonexistent navigation features and some other annoying aspects hold it back from being truly special.",
"At the risk of disappointing its detractors, Concord is a very good hero shooter that could very well overshadow the big names in the genre, if a community of players takes it that far. Firewalk's service game is based on solid arguments: great shooting sensations, 16 varied and perfectly oiled heroes, impeccable technique and artistic direction and even attractive tactical perspectives. As it stands, we just regret overly classic game modes as well as a universe that would have deserved a more important place within the experience... Two points that are not set in stone and that will most certainly improve with future updates (all free, there is no season pass or battle pass, let us remind you). A very good choice. We loved it.",
"Outrun Online Arcade doesn’t offer a whole lot of a different experience from recent Outrun games. The multiplayer is a bit of a mixed bag, but at 10 dollars (or 800 Microsoft Points) it’s a great arcade experience that can be a whole lot of fun.",
"South of Midnight is, for me, an unmissable experience despite playing it safe in a couple of key areas. This is an exceptional adventure that I simply couldn’t put down and I truly hope it’s not the last journey I’ll venture on with Hazel. While the combat and traversal is both entertaining and proficient, it does lack development as the game progresses creating somewhat of a repetitive feeling. But I couldn’t help but find myself partially overlooking that as South of Midnight offers such a remarkable story and what could be the year’s best soundtrack. Just like Hazel, South of Midnight occasionally stumbles, but it’s most definitely still a journey worth venturing on.",
"Endless Space 2 isn't just a very solid 4X game. It's also quite the narrative experience. Every faction has a story to tell, and every game will see you playing to their strengths while learning that story.",
"In ""Wipeout,"" when a missile is homing in on you, you are filled with a sense of dread and impending doom. In Drome Racers you just can&#146;t help thinking &#147;oh well, never mind&#148;, which sums it up nicely.",
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine has been a real surprise: its high levels of violence, enjoyable gameplay and good longevity make it overcome the average movie tie-ins crowd. Too bad its buggy and unpolished graphics keep it from reaching a better score.",
"After Us is a sombre, succinct and surreal adventure with a compelling and emotional tale of sacrifice and healing, tied together by simple platforming gameplay that evolves with each distinct and beautiful new environment. Some control complaints and unnecessary combat aside, it's a memorable journey worth taking.",
"Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition on Switch is a feature-packed and surprisingly playable port of a hugely entertaining game that provides a ton of fun for fans of the genre and Jurassic Park nuts alike. There are undeniably problems in handheld where the visuals take a pretty big hit and the framerate does struggle here and there in docked but, if you can deal with these issues, you'll find one of the most straight-up fun management sim offerings currently available on Switch awaits. So, who's hungry?",
"With a price tag of $39.99, it is really hard for me to recommend this game in 2017. Although there aren’t that many 1-on-1 shooter/fighters on the market, I do believe that your money would be better spent elsewhere. Maybe wait for a price drop before picking this up, if you really think that this will interest you.",
"Ultimately, Dungeon Defenders: Awakened is a very unique experience that will only improve with time if Chromatic listens to their players and updates regularly. The early game can be boring, especially when played alone. However, co-op is exciting at any time, and the late game is an absolute blast. In nightmare mode, stages begin to reach the perfect level of balance between challenge and fun. It isn’t for everyone, but if you’ve been craving some tower-defense, or loved previous Dungeon Defenders games, you’re sure to enjoy Awakened.",
"The improved graphics, faction ideas, better integrated story (the three warring races), the new tricks with special items, two new Planes, and incredible user interface upgrades all make Velious an excellent addition to EverQuest.",
"Mario & Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a cheap game for everything it contains. The time trial puzzle mechanics, like Pipe Mania, are fun and challenging. Over 200 stages and level editor.",
"Though patient motorcycle-simulation fans will see past Suzuki TT Superbikes' quirks and appreciate its authenticity, many will shy away from the game's single-track format, twitchy handling, and claustrophobic environment.",
"The Bit.Trip-series are about short, simplistic games and Void fits like a glove. You immediately understand the goal of the game and everyone can have a go at it, but the difficulty ramps up fairly quickly. It’s a shame there aren’t many levels and an online leaderboard would have been the perfect addition, but still, this experiment has succeeded.",
"Despite a not-so-smooth introduction of the huge anticipated Batmobile, Arkham Knight is an amazing game, and one of the best examples of open world games so far. The way you can interact with Gotham is remarkable, and there’s so much love for the DC’s comics that you can feel it in every corner of the city. Goodbye Rocksteady, and thanks for all the bats.",
"Splatoon 3: Side Order can be a fun and interesting take on the rogue-lite genre, but there’s simply not enough here to sustain everything the game wants you to do. There’s too much repetition here, and as a result the DLC leaves me feeling unsatisfied.",
"While the story may be uninspiring and some mechanics don’t quite stick the landing, I found myself returning to Shadows Awakening mostly for the amusing stories of the puppets. Even so, the characters alone can’t carry the game — maybe fans of this IP will be happy to jump in and will find the mediocre gameplay enough, but for those like me, it’s hard to recommend this title as a starting point to the Heretic Kingdoms world.",
"While lacking a great storyline and a camera in the game that could have been so much better, these are things that can be easily overlooked when you consider all the fun gameplay options available to you.",
"It is more than obvious that Monochroma's inspiration is derived -mainly- from the excellent Limbo, presenting a rather interesting dystopian world. Unfortunately the large number of bugs, the unimaginative riddles and the inability to create any interest for the fate of the two brothers make this game utterly forgettable.",
"Upon first inspection, I thought that NASCAR Kart Racing would be just another quick rush to capitalize the success of the Wii. In truth, this is a fun game that can be enjoyed by a large spectrum of people.",
A pedestrian real-time strategy game that barely manages to offer up the basic mechanics that define the genre. Add its failure to deliver the spirit we'd expect from the setting and there's very little to separate War Times from dozens of other all-too-predictable real-time strategy games.,
"Evotinction draws inspiration from a host of classic sci-fi influences, but flip flops between tropes and struggles to find an identity of its own. Its flat tone and atmosphere betray the beauty of its presentation, and what is really a basic story fails in many ways to hold itself together under the weight of its loftier ambitions. The action stealth certainly flirts with some interesting ideas, but a lack of balance and wonky execution unfortunately make it another imperfect cog in a machine that already has several. ChatGPT may rise up one day and decide that humans are a nuisance to be eradicated, but Evotinction fails to capture the potential horror of that.",
"While Four Quarters’ title operates under the trappings of casual gaming, I’d say that Loop Hero works for quick sessions, and also as a more dedicated experience that might keep one up for long hours into the night. It cherrypicks the right elements from each of the genres it takes inspiration from, and gives back a completely fresh experience with oldschool appeal.",
"The action is great when it gets going and the bosses will bring a smile to anyone's face. Whilst disappointing in some areas, it does match its budget price point and in some respects even exceeds it.",
"The game combines the series‘ strategic gameplay with mythological elements and the end result is really good. It’s not quite as complex as other Total War games, but the interesting setting, the different campaigns, the resource management and more make it an adventure you can invest dozens of hours in.",
"Lunacy, anarchy, drastic violence and stealth tactics wrapped in absurd amounts of pixelblood and psychedelic electro. You can love this game. You can damn it into the deepest hell. But you can't ignore it.",
"The improved gameplay adds realism but doesn’t take away the user-friendly experience is a definite asset, especially to a beginner. Most Madden games don’t add much to the game to warrant a purchase every single year, but the amount of tweaks in Madden 10 is definitely worth a look at the very least. It’s safe to say Madden 10 is the best Madden yet!",
"While fans of turn-based strategy might find some features to be enjoyable, long-time players of the Jagged Alliance series and strategy connoisseurs might feel shortchanged of the beloved gameplay of this genre.",
What the…? The original fascination we had with the franchise as a well rounded karaoke party game is gone. From all that was good almost nothing remains. I want my old SingStar back.,
"Close to the Sun is a great adventure, similar to a walking simulator but deeper and more complex. It does a great job with the setting and the story, although it fails to make the most of its gameplay.",
"An addictive railway management puzzler that will scratch the itch for the logical thinking part of your brain and is very enjoyable whilst doing so. Though, for some, it may become repetitive.",
"Sine Mora EX looks amazing, plays like a dream, and has a story that will leave players feeling bad about themselves and the world. That third thing may not sound like a selling point, but it’s so strange that I couldn’t help but be impressed by the audacity the developers had to include it. Horizontal Shmups don’t come smoother or better-looking than this, so it’s an easy recommendation for anyone with an interest in the genre.",
"Just based on the music selection, social/community functionality, and the fact that it's a new Lumines game for a new platform, Lumines: Electronic Symphony is totally worth checking out. Yes, it's priced too high and it isn't quite as packed with as many features as hoped, but it is still one of the best Lumines games yet.",
"I'll understand if you don't have a 3DS or if puzzle games aren't for you, but anyone with a classic sense of play can't deny the appeal of a brain-teaser. With so much content and puzzles that grow deeper and more complicated as you play, you need to get a move on and play Minis on the Move.",
"A great game and nobody should buy a PlayStation Vita without purchasing this Ubisoft game too. The same awesome gameplay of the first episode is still there, now with a couple of new tricks like the avatar's power up. The new soundtrack is just perfect and the stylish skins look great on the Vita screen.",
"The game is a little on the easy side. Ok, a lot on the easy side if you&#146;re good with puzzles but not too hard for kids and of course it suffers the fate of all puzzle games; When you&#146;ve solved them once, there is no challenge in solving them again.",
"Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a must-play for series vets looking to recapture the nostalgia of their first RTS experience, and well worth a look for new players looking to understand the roots of the RTS genre.",
"If a game's quality is based solely on its replay value, then Guardian Heroes for the Xbox 360 is as good a game as Gears of War 3 or Call of Duty: Black Ops. While Guardian Heroes has plenty, unfortunately games aren't rated entirely on replay value.",
Concord is another live service game that will be a cautionary tale to developers not to chase trends. A bog-standard hero shooter with messy meta game elements will not bring people over from Overwatch. The fact that they charge 40 euros for this will only be a detriment to the game and I personally expect the good old serviceshutdown.jpg on X in the near future.,
"So whether you’ve played Madden year after year, or have been a hold out since the 2K franchise’s demise, all fans of the pigskin will be happy to hear that this is the Madden to own no matter who you are. Not only is this the best representation of the franchise to date, but is quite possibly the best football title to date.",
"The passage of time can sometimes be kind to classic games. Where Klonoa was once compared unfavourably to the far more “innovative” platformers that were doing the rounds, perhaps now it can be judged on its own merits instead, and while neither of the two Klonoa games are especially flashy or spectacular, the subtle and nuanced whimsy that sits at their core offers a particularly potent foil to the self-seriousness that far too many modern games – even platformers – express. Whether you’re replaying these for nostalgia or discovering them for the first time, Klonoa’s going to win you over with this collection.",
Nintendo has a look back to the past and recovers good part of the Mario's gameplay history with a deep and challenging videogame. New Super Mario Bros Wii is really a must-have for Wii owners.,
"Though the game is marred by its short length and weak enemy AI, those looking for a fun and different shooter experience shouldn't have any hesitation about biting the bullet and taking a ride with the McCalls.",
"This is a game that could have badly used more polish. Still, it does many things I like, and if Zootfly brings this hero back for another colorful adventure, I'd be willing to give him a second chance.",
"Even if you end up missing the absent depth, the laid-back pace is a rewarding compensation. If only one-half of this mashup premise appeals to you, what you’re looking for may lie elsewhere. But if you’re looking to blend hacking, slashing, and smooching, Boyfriend Dungeon will be a perfect match.",
"Hellishly difficult trip to mysterious seas. Great idea, impressive atmosphere, but a good experience is sometimes spoiled by strange design decisions and a few irritating bosses. The true dagger in the back is the map for an extra fee. [Issue # 261]",
"This game is quite clearly meant to be a celebration of how ""kick-ass"" the SWAT teams are, and will probably provide a smattering of enjoyment for the more jingoistic out there. But it really has nothing to offer anyone else - it's just a poor version of Killzone on the PSP. Purchase at your own risk.",
Elements of Destruction is a nice simple little game that can be beaten in one sitting. The game is perhaps a little too simple though and the lack of variety in the attacks and the way they are used means the element of destroying buildings can become tiresome.,
"Completely mental, colourful, funny and an entertaining multiplayer experience, Wattam constantly surprised me with its surreal characters and insane gameplay. It will not be everyone's cup of tea but I think a lot of people will appreciate it for what it is. A bright, cheery experience that will leave you confused, baffled but smiling and laughing at the same time.",
While the gameplay is fun the whole experience is overly repetitive. Add in a confusing setting and a complete tonal shift from the anime and you get a game that does not live up to expectations.,
"Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a thematic triumph that makes you look past the gameplay lumps. Come for the western fantasy, revel in the visual presentation and get a decent shot of first-person action in between.",
"This is a great shooter, perhaps the best we have had this year, so far, and it is definitely a game that is looking to be on my top 5 list of games for 2012. We have been lucky to have some great titles come out this year and we still have some exciting titles on the release schedule too, but don't make an error and miss this gem. I really hope we get a third game in this series.",
"The game features a very strong playlist, but lacks in renewal. Next to that it's still impossible to play the game online, which should be an option by now. A great game for people that love karaoke for only 40 euros, but for the rest of us not really a must have.",
"Most importantly, Last Light incorporates a lot of lessons learned from the previous iteration. The big step from Metro 2033 in design, gameplay and polish make Last Light one of my favorite games of the year so far.",
"I was addicted to Boyfriend Dungeon for the two days I played it. While the game is not without flaws, I do wish that it had been longer. While having multiple flings in Verona Beach was a delightful romp, it always felt like there should have been more content than there was. However, I had so much fun playing this game, even when it became uncomfortable I still felt compelled to see where the story would go and how the characters would develop. Boyfriend Dungeon is the right kind of weird that keeps you wanting just one more dungeon run, even when it stalls out on you way too early.",
"When it does it right, Ronin creates beautiful and deadly choreography. But when it does it wrong, there's too much frustration in these action and turn-based puzzles to enjoy it fully.",
"Unless online gets patched I don't see myself going back there, and honestly unless somebody asks me to load it up, I won't be playing the Arcade Kollection much after this week. But ripping out spines, and desperately trying to remember the right spam moves to beat Motaro was a fun nostalgia break.",
"The creators of This is the Police 2 were not able to dismantle the gameplay routine of police chief's everyday work. The game's new feature - tactical missions - is well-made and really fun but this feeling ends very quick. You can't save your game during these missions which is very frustrating. Still, the story is great and the fans of the previous game will be happy.",
"It's a case of missed opportunity with Castlevania Judgment. The concept sounds so enticing, but it doesn't take long to realize that the series has not done a good job of creating memorable characters. It tries to implement creative ideas, but nothing really clicks and both die hard fans and fighting game enthusiasts will be discouraged by gameplay that's anything but immortal.",
"Aside from all the juicy extras and great multiplayer features, Midway is still able to showcase some really solid fighting action that translates well on the GBA. If you&#146;re a fan of the genre you can't go wrong with this one.",
Features like these mean Shattered Dimensions would actually work as a Spidey game even though it's not an open-world swingers' party. It's just a massive shame they're housed in such a linear and grindingly predictable format.,
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt turns us into vampires to show us the pros and cons. The formula of this Battle Royale offers a different proposal to what we know. The fights through the streets and rooftops of Prague will be part of the appeal of the game.,
"Even without multiplayer, though, there’s a good 20-plus hours of action packed into this fun little childhood throwback – more than enough to keep strategy fans occupied until the end of the summer.",
"The fact Last Light is absolutely stunning on the PC and packed full of crisp detail makes exploring and fighting through this hellish, dimly-lit realm an affecting and exhilarating experience. A few years and a lot of spit-shine make a huge difference on the visual front.",
"Valkyria Revolution is a title that undoubtedly suffers due to the comparisons to its superior predecessor. However, when viewed as a standalone title, it features an interesting story with a cast of characters well worth exploring. Even though the combat engine is dull and flawed in many ways, it’s serviceable for the scenarios that the game presents and at a bargain price, you could do worse than pick up Valkyria Revolution.",
"The sheer intensity of the firefights in this game makes it worth the money, and given that it’s relatively inexpensive to pick up (you’re looking at a $30-$40 dent in your wallet), it’s worth the majority of that money.",
"If you’re a fan of the western genre and era but are unsure about investing in Bound in Blood, worry no more. Without a doubt the best game in its genre for now, it’s a worthy investment. Rich single player, functional and enjoyable multiplayer which will be supported with downloadable maps, it ticks all the boxes.",
"Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games leaves us unsatisfied, even with its not so big ambitions. Even so, there is no excuse for this permanent lack of precision and this very inappropriate latency. Ice hockey and curling will probably make you smile, and graphics aren't that bad, but those are almost the only arguments the game can have.",
"Oftentimes the game will thrust you into difficult, unexpected situations with little warning; try-and-die when you only have a few attempts before starting the fairly lengthy levels all over again, is frustrating.",
"Despite the occasionally repetitive moment of combat, Wilson’s Heart is a must-play game that elevates narrative, visuals, sound, and gameplay for VR experiences to an entirely new level. Your time as Robert may have been a nightmare, but it’s a nightmare you’ll be eager to revisit again, and again, and again.",
"Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway is a karting game that copies the foundation of the genre, offers lots of characters and a good amount of courses and modes to unceremoniously fill many hours of your time. It's not a bad game, but it's not top-notch either. Younger players who like Nickelodeon cartoons might appreciate it as a gift.",
"The ultimate refinement of the Mario Kart concept; if you love that concept, you'll love the things Double Dash adds and enhances. If you were tired of the formula or never liked it to begin with, this game is not going to convert you.",
"It's absolutely jam-packed with features and if you're someone who already has Shovel Knight, it's a heck of a free addition. As a solitary game, it's a much harder sell. Like you said, it's more of a curio or bonus than something that could stand solely on its own.",
"It’s not particularly challenging, deep or narratively profound, but it is consistently funny in a wry, innocent way and outside of some physics quirks the platforming gameplay is engaging. Pikuniku is a game you keep playing because you want to see how it will make you smile next; what will the next odd little character exclaim? What will the next hat let you do? What minigame is around the corner? Pikuniku is arty and ludicrous without trying too hard or shoving a message down your throat, and in that regard it fits into Devolver’s stable of IP perfectly.",
"While it’s far to long, This Is the Police 2 is a cool little game, with a interesting scenario and lot of different situations to work on. But most of our reproaches for the first game stand still.",
"Ronin is a good game, with an excellent idea for combat that is slightly devalued by an almost absolute need to stealthily take out enemies before entering battle. It frequently reminds you that this is not a stealth game but it is with stealth that you often make the best progress.",
"Kart Racing may not be the most original title in the stable of franchises, but it sure is loads of fun, especially with four people. The lack of online does hinder the experience a bit, but if you don't care about taking it to cyber space and enjoy NASCAR even a little, there is a ton of fun to be had with this peculiar title.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition offers the best way to experience this timeless RPG for again or for the first time. The improvements to the game’s graphics, UI, and battle system make many complaints about the Wii release a thing of the past. Furthermore, the added Future Connected story content bridges the gap of loose story arcs and paves the way for the future of the series. It was a joy to once again group up with these characters and set out to uncover the mysteries of the Monado as this is truly one of the standout JRPGs of this generation.",
"I am convinced that eventually, somewhere in the world, Mario Party 5 will provide proof that a person can die from boredom while playing a video game. The single player mode has essentially no value.",
"If you're a dedicated fan of the Shadowrun setting and enjoy your games a little on the complex side, you will be disappointed in the lack of depth in Shadowrun Chronicles. If, however, you enjoy turn-based tactical action and cooperative multiplayer, you might have a blast with the game.",
"The open-ended gameplay, comprehensive overall design, and a strong replay value are the game's defining characteristics. Of course, this might not be enough to tackle with the big budget projects, but it's still worth checking out.",
"Khazan sorts out what he wants to keep from the Souls formula, rounding off the edges. It's a shame, though, that some elements that have little to do with the genre have managed to creep in.",
"Does not really bring anything new to the formula compared to the game released in 2014, which means you basically play the same game just with a different story and other puzzles.",
"The visual and audio aspects of Lumines: Electronics Symphony are one of the main reasons as to why the game is so compelling to play. Q Entertainment, the studio behind the game, does an astounding job of making sure all three parts (visuals, audio, and gameplay) fit together perfectly and it pushes this combination to new heights with Electronic Symphony.",
"In fact, nothing about Pikuniku bothers me. It’s a happy, fun little game that needs to be enjoyed by everyone who owns a Switch, and the world is a better place with games like this in it.",
"It's very obvious Raven had nothing to do with this game, and longtime fans of the series will notice in the first 20 minutes this isn't close to what the first Soldier of Fortune was. Who knew that gratuitous violence could be made boring?",
"Beyond its unique art style, Need for Speed Unbound doesn’t do anything to reinvent the steering wheel, but it doesn’t need to. This is Need for Speed, so you know what you’re here for - fast races, cop chases, and more cars than you know what to do with. Unbound is all of that packaged in the series’ most stylish entry to date.",
"It does do a great job at what it offers. Nearly all of the games are charming and fun &#150; even if they&#146;re not all that original, and the added appeal of online gaming solves the problem of having a party game but no friends to party with.",
"That's not to say it's a bad game, but those who own DOA5 may not get a whole lot more out of this title. At the same time, it's a great deal for those who didn't play DOA5 or are new to the series.",
"Entertaining, yet joyless. Beautiful, yet dire. After Us builds itself upon contrary subversions of videogame norms, and in many ways it succeeds. It’s just a shame that in its desperation to convey the importance of the planet's soul, it sacrificed a little of its own.",
"Despite the successful attempt at reimaging a classic, Commandos 2: HD has been delivered with a considerable number of bugs and performance issues. We also find the decision to remove all references to Nazism and Nationalist symbols an insult to the game's heritage and the WWII victims' memory. Quite honestly what does the game justice is its timeless gameplay.",
"Tinykin delivers a fun-sized chunk of satisfying 3D-platforming joy for all ages. Its charming cartoonish visuals and delightful cast of insectoids are bursting with personality and whimsy. While it doesn’t provide much of a platforming challenge and drags its feet a bit through some repetitive escort missions, it’s impossible not to smile at this joyous mini-world of anxious dung beetles and partying silverfish. A relaxing, cozy little adventure that will entertain the young-at-heart.",
"The Magic Obelisk is a truly wonderful puzzle experience that eases players in, challenges veterans further into the game, offers up an intriguing variety of characters throughout and wraps everything together in a gorgeous visually and aurally pleasing package.",
"Paleo Pines is by no means a bad game - it presents creative new mechanics and is a clear winner for any players who are big fans of dinosaurs. The experience just feels like it could've used a bit more time in the oven to perfect things like its graphics, direction, and the depth of its characters. It may not be perfect, but Paleo Pines offers a laid back and lighthearted adventure across a dinosaur-covered world that's well-suited for any player looking for a relaxing Jurassic adventure.",
"The differences and enhancements in Gears of War 2 feel very calculated and intelligent. It's clear that no one set out to break things that worked before, and the most dramatic steps were taken in an effort to widen the game's appeal to players who might not be good enough to play it, otherwise. But it takes on this task without dumbing itself down and alienating the people who already liked the first game...All you really need to know is that Gears of War 2 is a terrific, kick-ass shooter with enough stuff in it to keep you busy for a pretty long time.",
"Very much a powerful gaming experience and serves as a terrific companion piece to ""Hour of Darkness."" And it goes without saying that every role-playing PS2 owner out there needs to give this a try.",
"If FC 24 had shaken up some things a bit along with its name, starting with the gameplay, FC 25 has not taken this path at all. The considerable contribution this year is called Rush, a new way of playing 5 against 5 quite well integrated into all game modes alongside the classic 11-a-side football. Because even if the title integrates FC IQ, a new tactical and positioning system for AI players very interesting in Career and Clubs mode for budding managers, the gameplay hardly changes one iota compared to last season. Haters of the last opus may therefore move on, except for lovers of Kings League and Ligue 1. The latter will be able to rejoice to see many players from the French championship modeled unlike last year. Cocorico!",
"Pikuniku is a game that's light on content but huge on charm and creativity. The locations and characters in the brief adventure mode are brilliant, the goofy physics make for grin-inducing platforming and the dedicated co-op mode has some of the funniest two-player puzzling since Snipperclips. You might be left wanting more, but it's hard to argue that what's here isn't pure joy.",
"The first time I hit the nitrous on the incline of a culvert and launched an El Camino over a short one-story building to win a race, I thought this was a great racing game. But, three hours later when I jumped a motorcycle over a six-lane expressway after popping a wheelie up the extended arm of a utility truck, I knew this game was pure gold.",
"Sure, running around the dungeons and slashing through enemies is enjoyable enough -- and, dare I say it, even fun at times. But as soon as you attempt to play through Valhalla Knights like its an actual game, it completely falls apart.",
"It may not be my first pick for a puzzle game to play on the DS, but Super Collapse! 3 gives players a healthy variety of game modes and options to the point where the wealth of variety makes up for an otherwise mediocre core game.",
"Commandos: Origins strikes a great balance between the classic stealth tactics games and modern streamlined ideas, creating tons of potential for finding creative solutions to problems like “too many living fascists.” Pruning out elements like inventory management may not be to every older fan’s tastes, but that’s focused a spotlight on strict stealth – and it’s here Origins shines. Sneaking through its massive maps, each of which are swarming with hundreds of enemies, takes hours and hours of patient planning and careful clicking. I regularly gleaned a ton of pleasure from executing a perfect coordinated strike and fading away into the background, with the remaining Nazis none the wiser. No plan survives contact with this many bugs, but quick-loading will get you past nearly any issue and this otherwise might be the sneakiest fun you can have going commando with your underwear on.",
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is undoubtedly one of the cutest and most welcoming games that I've played in a long while. Sure, the experience may be slightly marred by a handful of minor faults, but Yonder more than compensates for these issues with its beautifully realised world and its enjoyably lighthearted tone.",
"Starship Troopers: Extermination has (inadvertently?) translated the anti-belligerent ideas of the film into a game so well that it makes us want peace, if only because we don't want to keep doing the same thing. The film argues that war is not fun. And the game isn't fun either.",
"Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is a space action game where we have to accomplish assignments in a mercenary corps, leaving the story in the background. Its direct action, a decent gameplay and good visual fluidity are the only things that can be highlighted in a title that ends up becoming repetitive and cold in most of its aspects.",
"As much as I enjoy building a legacy in a 4X game before starting over to do it all again, the fact that my legacy follows me in Age of Wonders 4 feels much more rewarding. And the faster pace of its very strong campaign mechanics and pretty good tactical battles make it feel like I can write a new chapter of this saga in a reasonable amount of time and still have time to do something else on my day off – especially with the very well-done story realms. Cranking all the dials up to maximum weirdness can lead to some edge cases that ruined my fun a bit, but it's not that big of a price to pay for the vast map and empire customization we get to play with. It really is wonderful.",
"The beloved classic returns with a lot of promise… but it doesn’t quite meet our lofty expectations. It looks, sounds and plays great, but there are downsides: you’ll find loads of bugs and glitches, some important features are missing and it turns out you can actually be too faithful to the original.",
"The game is wonderful artistically, but it just has far too many problems right now to recommend. The developers, Gato Studio, seem to recognize this and are preparing updates, but once again I find myself reminding game studios how badly things can go if you release something before it is ready. It is really hard to gain back the trust of players after you lose it.",
"Whether Unbounded is a game for you depends on temper. If you won't tire of always flooring the throttle and going through every corner sideways, this is a technically solid arcade racer that hits home more often than it misses. But if you demand more variety and focus on driving skills, you should look elsewhere.",
"Rollerdrome produces some badass moments with its combination of X Games action and bullet-time violence, but it doesn’t replicate what made the OlliOlli games such Zenlike fun. Those looking for a challenge will find it here, but given Rollerdrome’s bland presentation, imperfect controls, and grueling approach to level design, many players will quickly skate on to something else.",
"The Thaumaturge is a fairly unique RPG in terms of its setting and the themes it addresses. Narratively quite crazy and engaging from start to finish, it is worthy of a very good fantasy movie or a good gothic tale.",
"An ingenious game in a simple, effective package, which at first glance looks like a relaxed game, but as a result will squeeze even the last drop of your organizational and managerial skills before you disgracefully capitulate.",
"Fans of the original material will obviously get the most out of Crimson Elixir, but due to the stylized look and easy to pick up gameplay even newbies to FMA will find a lot to like. Its biggest flaw is the short length but it's definitely fun while it lasts.",
"The storyline alone makes this game worth taking a look at. Even though the driving aspects seem stiff and slow (and there is the occasional buffering/loading problem when you hit near the halfway point of the city), it is cool to tool around in the vehicles and on the streets of the 1930s.",
"King of Seas is an engaging enough game, offering good ship-to-ship combat and a generally fun time to play through when it doesn't weigh you down with excessive amounts of grind. If you stick through the grind, this is the sort of game that is more than good enough to drop in and out of, giving you a good outlet to meet your pirate-related urges.",
"Yonder Chronicles brings to the industry a game focused more on exploring, developing, and interactions over violence and leveling, and the end product is refreshing. A few things hold it back, but the heart and soul of the entire package is not to be denied on its way to success.",
"Another solid game from Nintendo &#150; it features a few new tweaks on the old formula but it&#146;s more or less the same game with new boards, new mini-games and a few new characters.",
"Yonder lacks combats, but that it's not a problem when you have a world as beautifully crafted as this is. Match it with addictive (although simple) crafting mechanics, and you have a unique adventure, where joy is found behind every new landscape.",
"Was the wait for Metro: Last Light worth it? Absolutely. Does the sequel offer more of the same? The answer is yes again, but it never feels like a disturbing factor. In fact, Artyom's new adventure becomes even more thrilling than its predecessor at times. Metro: Last Light may suffer from some bugs and yes, the game should be less linear. Simply put, however, this is one of the most solid shooters we've played in years.",
"It's hard as nails and has some balance issues that perhaps need to be addressed, but on the whole The First Berserker: Khazan is an impressive Soulslike that's very easy to recommend whether you're familiar with the Dungeon Fighter Online series or not.",
"After a week's worth of time spent in Rainbow Skies I have to say that even as someone who is not typically a tactical, turn-based RPG player, I appreciate how much has gone into Rainbow Skies. It definitely scratches that particular itch with great progression mechanics, an intriguing world and story, and some great tactical combat. However, the game's unbalanced pacing in story delivery coupled with some serious “what do I do now” moments hamper this otherwise fun tactical, turn-based RPG.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles is a lesson on how to make a good RPG and is probably one of the most influential RPG games in the past decade, great for beginners in the genre and very challenging to those who want challenges, needing only to toggle the Expert Mode. Replaying this classic that already has two sequels was a great experience.",
"Like a lot of grumpy Eastwoods, Juarez treads the line just West of parody with Ray's juxtaposition of gravely scripture one minute, and then little red circles with lines through them hovering over whiskey bottles the next.",
"FFXII is a gargantuan, gorgeous game with a gripping plot, likeable characters and an interesting new combat system that injects some much-needed life into the series. Wonderful. [JPN Import; June 2006, p.44]",
A highly imaginative experience that walks the fine line between compulsion and frustration that any good puzzler should provide. Further refinement on the concept and level design to reduce the emphasis on trial-and-error gameplay would have resulted in a more appealing experience.,
"From Software's older RPGs were barely playable, but this one was one of my favorite RPGs of the year. The eye candy is the game's defining feature, but it doesn't attempt to stand on that aspect alone.",
"This is definitely a game aimed at the hardcore, old school crowd. Newcomers to the real-time strategy genre will find that the campaign is difficult to the point of near total aggravation.",
"RPG Maker Fes does what it needs to do. That is to make sure everyone can build a RPG easily. But the game is limited in what it offers. Moreover, there should have been some explanation of what everything does.",
"After Us stands as a thought-provoking testament to human responsibility, but it leaves untouched the broader canvas of nature's relentless force. Recognizing both sides of this environmental equation would have offered a more comprehensive perspective on the intricate dance between humanity and the natural world, underscoring the urgent need for responsible stewardship of our planet. The gameplay is serviceable and the game's length won't leave anyone asking for more, but the real showstopper is its gorgeous visuals and ambiance.",
"GWENT: Rogue Mage is an expansion suited for players who need new challenges, like to test their patience and improvise strategies. But because of a rather repetitive gameplay and disappointing story, it’s a game that casual fans of Gwent can easily skip.",
"Simply put, there’s almost nothing one can reasonably complain about with Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition. What we have here is an already excellent JRPG that has been improved in nearly every conceivable way, short of a complete reimagining. On top of the fantastic story, enjoyable combat, and incredible world design, Monolith Soft has included an entirely new epilogue story arc while somehow improving upon and polishing up nearly everything in the base game, from progression systems to visuals to UI design. Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is easily one of the greatest RPGs available on the Switch to date, and will no doubt stand the test of time. It goes without saying that if you were ever a fan of the original or of RPGs in general you absolutely must get this game for your collection as soon as you reasonably can. Even if you wouldn’t consider yourself a fan, we would still strongly encourage you to think about adding this one to your collection, as this is the standard against which most RPGs should be judged.",
"I have nothing but good things to say about Knights and Bikes, it has a great story, great presentation and it is fun to boot. It has a beautiful art style, great music and will keep you entertained throughout its short but very sweet campaign. If you like simple but entertaining games, you will love it, as I did.",
"The gameplay remains fast and furious, and the simple controls do a masterful job of literally keeping you on track. The interplay between the characters in two-player mode is particularly impressive.",
"If you haven&#146;t played this game, you need to. The game featured big tracks, jumps, engine heat, and a track editor. The only downfall was you couldn&#146;t save tracks &#150; the GBA fixes this.",
"A good bet for your entry into the RPG genre, or if your parents will only buy you educational games. Otherwise, it’s decent, but nothing you haven’t played before and probably better.",
"Overwhelmingly good. This game is one of the finest gridiron products on the market with great gameplay, smooth graphics and options that would take all day to describe. While perhaps not a perfect football game (if there is such a thing), NFL 2K3 definitely raises the bar.",
"Between story-driving sequences in Mexico and Arizona, there are opportunities to saddle up and explore. These open-world breaks are a handsome reward—not fully realized sandboxes, but vast, lovely diversions from the dirty business of unraveling a family tragedy.",
HAL Laboratory fails to innovate at all within the puzzle genre and throws many of the same obstacles at you over and over again—to the point where BoxBoy! is as plain a platformer as its monochromatic motif.,
"When it's all said and done, all laughed and cried, Wattam really is a game apart from the pack - a clear continuation of the creative mindset of its maker, given what he's done before now, but also quite, quite different. It follows its own playful logic, offering clear instructions and never giving into surrealness for the sake of it, and is absolutely a more meaningful experience than meets the eye.",
"All you need to know is that if it was a poker hand, Forza would be a royal flush. If a football score, it would be a 7-0 win. As a game, it is the finest straight-up racing game to grace any home console system and as such, is an absolute must buy.",
"Track Lab is an interesting title. If you're looking at it as a game, it has some great puzzle mechanics, but there's only enough content to last you about an hour unless you get stuck on one of the puzzles. If you're looking at it as a music creation tool, the interface is novel but not something you'll use to seriously create tunes, especially since there's no easy way to export your creations. Ultimately, Track Lab is more of a fun toy in VR but not something you'll be itching to visit more than a few times.",
"If the whole game were as good as the last part, it might have matched the games that inspired it, but instead Al Emmo is just a decent game for fans nostalgic for old-style adventures.",
"Splatoon is just what we wished for in a sequel, a big improvement from the previous title. It's maybe too conservative, but it's also true that the new characteristics of Splatoon 2 are awesome.",
"It's fascinating the game goes to such lengths in the narrative and it is this that keeps the .hack//G.U. interesting. It's a little open-ended as it's the first in a series of three games, but you can continue to play other levels after the story ends.",
"While sometimes skirting a bit close to the line between inspiration and clone, Rogue Heroes has a lot to love. If you have a few friends to take dungeon crawling with you, you will laugh together, you will loot together, and you will have to work as a team to succeed. My boys and I got a lot of enjoyment from playing Rogue Heroes, and I think most other players will do too.",
"When it comes to card games, Loop Hero brings a unique and refreshing take to the table. While initially its format may take some getting used to and its graphics may appear simple, the game’s mechanics pack a surprising punch. With cards generating complex enemies, resources, and terrains, no two playthroughs in Loop Hero will be the same. Through this impressive degree of variety and replayability, Loop Hero offers a unique challenge for card game newbies and veterans alike.",
"A fantastic experience that scratches that survival horror itch better than most games. Playing on Ranger mode is probably the most intense experience I have ever encountered, and the gorgeous visuals really drag players into the dark, damp world.",
"Re-releasing updated versions of classic titles has become something of a trend, but Guardian Heroes isn't just another title hopping on the bandwagon. This is a port that has been given proper care, resulting in a game that is still solid all around. Top that off with a bargain 800 MSP ($10 USD) price point, and there's little reason not to add Guardian Heroes to your collection.",
"Hard West 2 is a classic game at heart with a progression system that is lacking. However, the fantastic western atmosphere, coupled with a neat narrative and combat that is both satisfying and varied in tactical situations, make the game a good pick up, both for fans of the genre and for those who would like to learn about turn-based strategy games.",
"If you're incredibly desperate for a sidescroller, then Blade Kitten will waste a handful of hours for you, and might even scratch your itch. You really would have to make sure there's nothing else left to play before considering opening your wallet for this, though.",
"Bloodborne meets Legend of Zelda worked out much better than I would’ve ever hoped. The bosses can have quite the malicious edge to them, especially a supremely sadistic second boss, and the platforming can be, quite literally, hit or miss. Nonetheless, the combat is so fluid but focused that it’s hard not to fall in love with how it handles. Cleaving apart zombies, then immediately whipping around to pistol-snipe a wolf all set to a firm and punchy soundtrack is just icing on the cake, especially with the added flavor the better bosses bring to the table.",
"Time Crisis: Razing Storm's arcade gameplay lacks the challenge and variety needed to make it worth replaying. And rather than trying to advance the genre for a home audience, Namco has opted for a cheap imitation of Western FPS games that feels completely out of place.",
"It's such a shame that the singleplayer takes just a few hours to complete. Because it's a fantastic game to play, probably the best hack and slash title in a science fiction setting. Raiden shows us how cool he is.",
"The best thing about Nippon Ichi's games is the way they strike such a good balance between accessibility and depth, and La Pucelle is another good example of this philosophy. [July 2004, p.85]",
"Something of a one trick pony. It’s all done competently, and there’s certainly enjoyment to be found here, but it lacks character; that exciting spark or polish that distinguishes the truly great RTS games. Once the novelty of the dual layer system wears off you’ll pine for a fresher, less workman-like, experience.",
"Senko no Ronde 2 offers a satisfying blend of genres that results in some engaging competitive gameplay. Considering you need plenty of patience to master its complex controls, make sure you're willing to put in the necessary effort before entering the arena.",
"When it comes down to it, if you’re really, really interested in seeing a bit more of the world and character from the film, then you might have some enjoyment with this game, but just a little. But without some varied combat or something that doesn’t feel like filler, it’s hard to say that anyone else will enjoy it.",
"Banana Mania is the best celebration for the 20th anniversary of the Super Monkey Ball series. It is full of fun with a lot of levels and minigames that any nostalgic fan would enjoy. Also, it's a celebration of SEGA with a lot of guest characters like Sonic, Tails, Beat, Kiryu Kazuma and Morgana from Persona 5.",
"Urban Trial Playground may not reinvent the stunt bike wheel, but it does provide an extremely fluid and inviting arcade experience for Switch owners. Tactile controls and pacy, highly replayable levels make this an accomplished cut-price racer package.",
"Following to the letter its own formula in terms of gameplay, controls, structure and open world design, Forza Horizon 5 becomes the new pinnacle of the franchise due to the special way that it transports us to the beautiful Mexican landscapes, taking harnessing all the power of the Xbox Series X to become one of the first games of this new generation that undoubtedly feels like a new generation. Some rough edges at the level and interface and progression slow it down from true perfection, but its virtues overshadow those flaws and of course, make it one of the best games of this 2021.",
"For those with no time or emotional investment in the series, this role-playing game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw, blander in appearance than most PSOne titles, and has more grating dialogue than a rerun of ""The Facts of Life."" [Jan 2005, p.125]",
"It's a mixed experience, with moments of enhanced fun thanks to new gameplay features, but also frustrating issues in regards to goalkeeper and tackle behavior. While Rush is a welcome addition, other areas like slow menus, moderate updates to game modes, and weaker tactical options compared to its predecessor fall short. The game shines in terms of visuals and technical performance, running smoothly on PS5, delivering impressive graphics.",
"It may not have next-gen graphics or a fantastic plot but it does play well, even after 16-years and once I started playing, I had to finish this game... one more time, in the 21st century.",
"The technical aspects are not only eye-popping but they’re also quite stable. The graphics are slick, the sound is stellar, the control is rock solid, and the gameplay variety is downright tremendous. I love the blending of puzzle, stealth, action, and adventure, and you have to give mad crazy props to the overall game design. I still say the story could be less predictable (perhaps give the player a little more credit in terms of literary comprehension) and the Batmobile, as awesome as it can be, is just overdone.",
"A perfect sister specimen of the German Nazis; though it has high ambitions and generally operates as a differentiated tactical game and employs a wealth of detail, beauty, and intricate depth, it’s ultimately defeated by its own shortcomings and underdeveloped foundations.",
"While Ubisoft has added 50 new minis and colored the experience with unlockable costumes and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support (for high score tracking), the core games are less enjoyable than those in the first, which is very disappointing.",
"Unadulterated run-'n-gun goodness. Future Perfect is packed with so many features that even the most jaded FPS fans will find something they like on offer; decimating everything or hosting a multiplayer kill-a-thon, this game can accommodate all comers.",
"A game that in spite its solid design and adherence to the extreme sports game blueprint, just seems a bit too formulaic. What&#146;s missing is that intangible ingredient, which keeps the player coming back for more.",
"The sheer scale of ""cosmetic surgery"" in Resurrected is mind-boggling, and that’s exactly what we’ve been promised. At the same time, 20-year old gameplay tropes raise quite a few questions, especially if you’re used to the conveniences of modern action/RPGs.",
"Playing EA Sports FC 25 provided lots of fun. The new things are cool, the online matches go on without problems, and crossplay guarantees rivalry between people with different platforms. But I can't look past all the technical issues - if not for them, the final grade would be higher.",
"If you like making music, you need to try this game. It’s an amazing experience in VR, and the puzzles it offers are very enjoyable as well. It might be a little bit confusing at the beginning, but just give it some time and feel the music.",
"The limits to which the team has managed to stretch the PS2's capacity are pretty amazing - it's hard to believe this is the same graphics engine that was used in the first game. [March 2005, p.98]",
"As an introduction to Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, then, the game's adventure elements are mostly a conduit for the humor, the bread to the cheese. And yeah, the bread may be a little mediocre in this case, but the cheese can be divine.",
"Tinykin is a platformer suitable for everyone. It entertains with its cheerfulness and simplicity, has a good pace, and immerses us in a small world characterized by a pleasant style. There is never a real flicker that makes it unique and the difficulty level is very low, but if you are a fan of 3D platformers full of collectibles Tinykin will be able to give you five or six hours of healthy entertainment.",
"The return to Zenozoik will please gamers looking for something different from the ordinary in terms of atmosphere, visuals, and overall vibe. The gameplay, however, has issues that, on occasion, can prove to be frustrating.",
"Not many games in this genre are released with a $20 price tag, so some gamers out there might not really know how to deal with a game that is a little light on the content but much lighter on the price.",
"You'll never run out of play options with the unlimited grab bag of pedal to the metal race variants available. Alas, the sometimes tedious gameplay and boring visuals can prompt repeated sabbaticals, but hey, this is a conversion of a slightly above average console game; you get what you pay for.",
"It's been a while since I have laughed this hard at and with a game. From the light-hearted start to the furious finale, I spent 80 percent of LEGO City Undercover either with a smile on my lips or a big laugh in my throat. In many ways, there not being a second license on top of the LEGO brand seems to have freed up a lot of the humor that was previously untouched upon, in spite of the other LEGO games being pretty funny in their own right. But here, instead of taking on just one or a couple of films as a basis, TT Fusion just did whatever they felt like. Sometimes dryly humorous, sometimes more absurd, sometimes just incredible even – this is pure bliss on a disc.",
"A lightweight, yet fun, title which should appeal to those who are new to the Strategy genre, or those that want a more relaxing experience. Its only major drawback is that its more of a sidestep than a revolution of the series.",
Arma III is a disgrace for the gaming world. It feels like it’s rushed to the market and still in the alpha phase of developing. Bohemia Interactive will have to release a buck load of patches to make this game work properly. This is unfortunate as they could have spent that time trying to deliver a good game.,
"Pikuniku is an absurd puzzle-exploration game that takes place in a strange but colorful place, where the characters are not as happy as they seem. Fun and enjoyable to play, but too short.",
"Supposing that anyone of a mature age does have the patience to endure the yelling and whining of little girls (in English AND Japanese!!), a serious strategist won't be happy with this one.",
"It can't provide the immersive realism of its console counterparts, but it does manage to recreate all the fun of playing with ants and matchbox cars -- especially if you liked blowing them up and setting them on fire.",
"Boxboy is an easy-to-overlook entry in the 3DS digital library. It’s inexpensive and doesn’t have a particularly remarkable look about it, but its well-designed puzzles continue to surprise, making it absolutely worth playing.",
"Like Katamari Damacy, Wattam is a feast of visual gags and imagination. But Takahashi’s newest project ultimately doesn’t have the necessary depth of gameplay to transform itself into more than a silly yet loveable romp.",
"Dark Sector can best be described as a game born out of a formula. To create this game, you will need 2 parts Gears of War, 1 part Resident Evil, and a dash of X-Men. It is totally easy to rip this game to shreds based on this description. But as you play this game, something unexpected happens: you find yourself having an amazing amount of fun.",
"Mix together a comic book character with some God of War/Tomb Raider gameplay, then cook it with a high degree of passion and you'll have X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A violent, entertaining affair that looks as good as it plays and doesn't hold back for the squeamish.",
"The control scheme is a bit clumsy, especially when trying to perform resource management or save a game. The graphics aren't exactly first cabin, either, although the sound effects are stellar. [Apr 2004, p.40]",
"Even so, while the tragic backstory is worth seeing through and the cell phone concept is novel for a while, all that’s left beyond that is a poorly-paced exploration in the dark, punctuated by a series of startling yet repetitive ghost encounters. So unless that’s your idea of a good time, this is one number that’s probably not worth picking up.",
"To keep things short and sweet: I see no reasons to play MMA Onslaught. Bellator licence and a handful of well recreated real fighters mean nothing if the game itself is lousy. [10/2012, p.65]",
"The campaign is quite lengthy, there is a ton of story to read through, and there’s even essentially choose-your-own-adventure stories inside other characters’ minds. However, the story is very quirky, and although developer Gust attempted to go deeper in characterization, a lot of the drama that unfolds feels at about the high school level.",
"A rock solid hack and slasher, Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star offers non-stop, totally over-the-top action from a fantastically fun cast of playable characters. Our only real complaint is that repetition can bleed into the experience over time, but give yourself a few days to recover from the fatigue, and you'll come back to a welcoming brawler that's stuffed with content. It's not quite up there with the best musou games on the market, but The Umbral Star scratches that button bashing itch and then some.",
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction has one special feature that really sets the game apart: insane difficulty. Everything else is secondary. Only the extremely patient, skilled, or masochistic Yu-Gi-Oh players will love this game.",
"Trek to Yomi is a well-made game, and, in some aspects, even great. If you like this type of adventure and a focus on the artistic style, as well as the samurai atmosphere, go for it! I really hope Trek to Yomi sells well since I'd like to see more.",
"Packed with a bevy of features, TimeSplitters Future Perfect is a cornucopia of candy-coated goodness for any FPS fan. If you start now, you just might be able to unlock everything by the time ""Halo 3"" ships to stores.",
"It's a bit of a yawn that ends up feeling like a barely good enough cash-in. The environments and characters are largely well-done, but the control scheme and dull mini-games drag SEGA Superstars Tennis down.",
"Burning Skies has many flaws, make no mistake about it. But despite all these flaws I've had quite a lot of fun with the game and I'll probably return to it many times, especially for the multiplayer.",
"4A Games created an excellent, apocalyptic setting with Metro: Last Light. You’ll be confronted with scary monsters and many details in the game offer a great atmosphere. Though, interaction with characters and the world itself in the game is limited. The AI doesn’t perform very cleverly, even on hardcore-mode.",
"Yes, it is a platformer; but the excellenet play mechanics coupled with the unlockable movie clips and smooth character animations make this title a pleasant surprise. [August 2002, p.91]",
"Wins you over with a fantastic atmosphere and a beautifully realized universe. The sequences where you feel both exposed, hunted and powerless offer a kind of action that is all too rare these days.",
"Given the game’s structure will usually lead to short playthroughs, these short sessions won’t feel that empty and with the amount of unlockables means I’ll be playing for quite the while before all the empty jars in the opening area are filled. With this summer having other similar platformers releasing (La-Mulana 2, Iconoclasts, Chasm, Salt and Sanctuary, Death’s Gambit, and Guacamelee 2), Dead Cells definitely will hold its own and it will be in contention to be one of 2018’s finest.",
"Diablo II: Resurrected shows why the original title remains the standard against which all other ARPGs are judged. While it doesn’t come with many hooks and ever-evolving content that has become a baseline for the genre as it transformed into a game-as-service model, not all games need to be played with forever in mind. Diablo II: Resurrected proves that Blizzard’s classic is still a blast, even today. Whether it’s your first foray into hell and beyond or your thousandth hour, Diablo II: Resurrected is worth the time.",
"Jagged Alliance: Rage! is the type of game that will surely bring back memories of the golden age of gaming, and for those of you that haven't lived through those days, this game will probably bring back memories you never had. Although it could use some tweaking here and there and the graphics are a dead giveaway for the limited budget the company had, the game is fun nonetheless, and you'll be spending a good couple of hours finishing all the missions with your first pair of mercenaries, and maybe a few extra hours with another pair.",
"While you’ll become overly familiar with the limited number of levels, the arrangement of enemies and power-ups is always different. No two fights feel the same. Like the brilliant Tetris Effect, Superhot deftly sidesteps monotony and instead becomes hypnotic, inducing the zen-like trance state of the archetypal action hero when deep in the throes of violence. Ultimately it doesn’t matter who you’re fighting or why. What matters is the fight itself, the spectacle and the flow. Superhot’s self-directed choreography emerges triumphant; stylish, dynamic and gripping.",
"After years in the wilderness, RTS is pretty cool again right now, and something as cheerfully straightforward as this is just what's needed to stop the big braininess of ""Company of Heroes"" and ""Supreme Commander"" leading to another plunge into an inaccessibility that turns more casual players off the whole genre.",
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage has a lot going for it—a compelling mystery, a strong cast of characters, and a nostalgic atmosphere that captures the era perfectly. But the technical issues are hard to ignore. From audio glitches to animation bugs, it feels like the game needed more time in the oven. I’m hopeful that Part 2 will smooth out these rough edges, because there is certainly some potential here. It’s just not quite there yet.",
"Tropico 3 is a difficult, but never an unfair game. Is your financial plan in order, then the political problems will rise on the table, and vice verse. You can never rest and stay on guard for new problems to solve. Before you can solve every problem in the right way you might be a couple of games further. That’s also because of misplaced buttons and options. It is a little downfall on the ‘build your paradise’ game that despite of those small problems, shines like a tropical sun on a usually bright day in paradise.",
"Like all board games, Gremlins Inc is designed to be played with friends. If you're going to play this on your own, it's hard to recommend, but if you want to destroy your friendships by cheating over everyone on your path to victory, this might be a digital board game that's worth your while.",
"I can’t say that Wattam makes for anything other than a clever diversion, best for parents and young children or those besotted with cuteness. The game teeters over the line between childlike and childish.",
"Though there’s supremely little that the developers have brought to the genre in Ankh, merely having the guts to present to us something in a genre that’s seen as ‘boring’ by the vast majority, means that we have to heap praise upon Ankh’s talented developers. But the way that everything has been put together outweighs the lack of originality in the gameplay and pushes Ankh towards classic status.",
"Cases of repetitious dialogue occur far too frequently, as does the odd graphical glitch. Plus the somewhat childlike visuals and script may turn off those who fell in love with the more mature humour of the early LucasArts titles.",
World of Final Fantasy may look like Pokémon but it's much more Final Fantasy at its core. It's colorful and more intriguing than it initially appears and runs really well on Switch.,
"Forza Horizon 5 is indeed the FAST & FURIOUSLY good and if you’re looking for a true next-gen racer, it’s finally arrived! And like Dom Toretto, Forza Horizon 5 lets you live your virtual life at a quarter mile at a time.",
"If you’re a fan of the franchise you’ll be getting this for new challengers Jacky Bryant, Rachel, Momiji, Leon and Ein. The Power Launcher move is about the only new mechanic addition. It looks hilarious, won’t rock worlds. [November 2013, p85]",
"If gathering resources, exploring, and “go get this for this, or find an item or persons for this” kind of quests are your deal or if you just want a change of pace, Yonder: the Cloud Catcher Chronicles is just for you. More experienced players may find some of the shallowness of the story and game play to be a little off putting. However younger players and those that desire a passive bit of simple gaming away from the loads of violence driven games with no choice but violence in them will have a good time with Yonder: the Cloud Catcher Chronicles. Though I must give this warning… you may smile.",
"Subtlety is what makes Last Light such an exceptionally immersive game. It nails the core tenets of a shooter, then forces you to react to enemies in ways outside of simply taking cover. It plops you in a post-apocalyptic world, then fills it with tons of minor but substantial details, like the shadows of once-living people now permanently nuked into stone walls. It strips you of hope, only to dangle a tiny sliver of it ahead of you like a carrot on a stick.",
"Stand Alone Complex may have proved to be a success on the home console market, but it feels oddly fractured on the PSP, suffering from its own shameless sense of self-importance while failing to provide any opportunistic innovation to a fairly blank and open genre canvas.",
"This sequel plays more like a shooter than its predecessor, but doesn't sacrifice its intricate narrative or creative vision in the process. Masochistic fans will appreciate the harder difficulties that recreate the grueling experience of the original, but no matter how you approach it, exploring Last Light's absorbing world is wholly entertaining.",
Röki tells a compelling story about what remains of an unfortunate family using a typical dark fairy tale tone. It is a classic adventure game with a modern twist and an amazing art design.,
"The video game monster of Dr. Frankenstein, Valkyria Revolution is a huge pile of dozens of mismatched, poorly designed systems, bland presentation and poor design choices all over the board. It bears no similarities to its wonderful predecessors apart from an interesting plot, which is unfortunately torn apart by the thousands of cutscenes and loading screens.",
"As long as you change the voice-overs to the original Japanese dialog, the game will be tolerable. If you have been looking for a traditional, turn-based RPG for the Xbox 360, then this one is a nice option.",
"Arma 3: The newest installment of Bohemia's military-game is more than ever an excellent platform and sandbox with great potential. Especially since the community has built much in-game content so far. Unfortunately the game-content, included by the developers, is not satisfying enough. The units and game-areas are great, but there are many bugs with AI, scripts and more and only a few multiplayer scenarios available.",
"A marvelous and unique delight of a murder mystery, one you’ll have walked away from feeling shocked over what exactly you just saw play out in the story, satisfied over the challenging puzzles you’ll have solved to help out each masked guest, and dazzled over the vibrant and mesmerizing aesthetics. Well, I say you’ll have walked away from it, but there’s still a good chance you’ll still go back if you feel you may have missed any secrets those luxurious and deadly walls may have held. Cavalier Studios have crafted one of this year’s most refreshing adventure games that is absolutely to die for.",
"The story paints something that feels all too real-world with things like police corruption and right-wing smoke screening. Combined with real-world visuals of the city mixed with gorgeous graffiti-like special effects, it all mixes into a fantastic racing experience that is hard to quit. The only gripe is an incredibly slow progression system.",
"Gaijin continues to do a wonderful job of meshing new gaming ideas and trance music with the look and feel of classic gaming. Void is not the most immersive or innovative title you will ever play, but it goes a long way at standing out in the crowd of me-too shooters and platform wannabes.",
"Total War Saga: Troy is a step in an interesting direction. The “Saga” distinction allows the team to try some new concepts without disturbing the main franchise, and it does while remaining faithful to the historic roots of its predecessors, with a dash of the fantastical. Some technical wobbles remain, and the game can be occasionally obtuse, but there’s a lot to enjoy here.",
"Super Princess Peach is Super Mario for dummies. It's also Super Mario for girls, who, according to Nintendo, are just dumber versions of men that get all emotional when they can't find their vibro wands.",
"Age of Empires: Definitive breathes new life into an absolute classic, and allows us to put on those rose-tinted glasses for another long campaign across the map, dominating through any means possible and constructing an empire very few could dream of.",
"Hellbound offers some old school fun if you enjoy putting your aim and reflexes to the test. It’s a shame the developers stopped at seven levels, one boss fight, a handful of monsters, and six weapons (of which two are useless and some lack an alternative fire mode). What would have been merely a first episode in a 90’s shooter, pretends to be a whole campaign in Hellbound. If you’re experienced with the genre, you’ll finish the game in around two hours. [10/2020, p.82]",
"If you missed the original ""Hunter: The Reckoning"" because you just purchased your Xbox, then you have a chance to see what made the original so good. The only thing that really for me takes some of the replayability off this game is a lack of online gameplay.",
"While some of the controls can be a bit bothersome, the overall gameplay mechanics and sense of enjoyment is overwhelming. Mix one of the most gratifying cooperative campaigns in recent history with an absolutely charming cast of characters, and you have an addictive upper echelon independent game.",
"While the merits and the story are shallow and uninteresting, the gameplay’s failure to integrate with them reduces them to superfluous trappings that can mostly be ignored. This leaves the focus squarely on the puzzles, and it’s here that The Sojourn almost hits the mark. Although they don’t fully reach their potential, the levels are at times deep and fascinating — and neither of those words could apply to the script.",
"Apart from racing up papery billboards and conjuring spectral trees to propel us over gaps, the platforming bits are spoiled by Gaia’s awkward handling. Combat against the remaining ‘devourers’ is worse, as you run around mashing the trigger to ‘redeem’ your gloopy pursuers. It’s basically a well-meaning but tedious lecture, telling you absolutely nothing you didn’t already know. [Issue#29, p.90]",
"Definitely worth picking up for the folks that already know they like these games, and if you have any worries about how the Move will control a title like this, I think this game will put those worries to rest.",
"An update that brings the series to current times. Maybe some of its changes will disappoint series followers, but it is as addictive as always. Classic gameplay, a great campaign, good community features and a great artistic design, this sixth entry in the series provides hours of fun.",
"If Telltale can figure out a way to weave together all of the possible branches in the story to create a second season (and beyond), then that will hopefully make all of the doom and gloom from the first season more worthwhile. But if Telltale has painted themselves into a corner, and this season is it, then I wouldn’t recommend the game at all, unless your idea of fun is getting punched in the face repeatedly.",
"The physics issue on its own isn't that big of a flaw, but when you combine it with the occasionally questionable bullet hit detection, it becomes more aggravating...So though it's far from perfect, it is a good overall game.",
"Firefall probably is the most innovative MMO of the last period, whose indisputable merits are, however, counterbalanced by significant technical gaps as well as a general flatness of end-game contents. Worth much, but it could've been even better.",
"With a weak story, awkward puzzles and a clich&#233; environment, Alida makes for one weak adventure game experience. Not only that, but everything here has been done (and much better) a decade ago.",
"Overall, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron continues the great work of its predecessor and also takes that to new heights. The campaign is visually rich, highly playable and gripping throughout, while the multiplayer offers incentive to come back for more. Most crucially, though, High Moon Studios has again done justice to these much-loved, shapeshifting robots.",
"The detractions are small but numerous. The poor handling of branded aftermarket parts, lack of real-life tracks, and tediousness of switching from racing to tuning are tops in the small flaws department.",
"A Space for the Unbound is a brisk 15-hour story that is full of surprises and potent emotional beats. While it doesn’t offer much in the way of replayability, it’s a hugely memorable experience nonetheless.",
"Lumines Plus retains its predecessor's addictive play on the PlayStation 2; providing excellent replay value, featuring numerous unlockable skins and two-player action guaranteed to wear out the ol' Dual Shock 2 controllers.",
"There is a slight underlying frustration in Tech Support — an inability to articulate exactly what you want to say. But a part of me feels like it perhaps adds to the experience. There is an overall feeling of being trapped, whether that’s in the endless cycle of query and response, or in the narrative. It plays on the fact that Tech Support is both a permadeath game and one that relies heavily on decision-making and branching narrative paths. On the whole I’m impressed by how much the game accomplishes using comparatively little, building what amounts to, a fairly full-on gaming experience. In many ways, Tech Support could be a hell metaphor for troubleshooters.",
"A solid turn-based roguelike with traditional rules, transparent, fair gameplay, and distinctive atmosphere resembling Doom. It becomes repetitive and monotonous in longer sessions, but it’s a perfect title to launch in between other games. [10/2021, p.51]",
"Much like the medieval weapons in use, Griefhelm’s lack of polish is easily recognizable. If this were an early access lower-priced title, the wild ragdoll effects and clumsiest moments would be quickly excused by consumers. Griefhelm’s developer does seem to be improving aspects of the AI and gameplay with recent and consistent updates, but the unsophisticated final product on offer amounts to a risky recommendation at best.",
"It's hard to imagine that Corvette, though it's priced to compete with a case of Bud, will be able to satisfy. There are much more competitive racers that also feature the fabled 'vette, along with decent physics, AI, and play modes.",
"Omen of Sorrow is a very competent fighting game. It just doesn’t have the same level of polish that so many others have. And there’s the problem: for its current retail price of £44.99/$49.99, you’d expect more.",
"While Onimusha: Warlords may be an older game, I believe it has stood the test of time fairly well, and has gotten me interested in checking out the later entries. The game is thoroughly enjoyable the whole way through with very few dull moments. Overall the game, albeit a short one, provides a great experience that culminates into a strong title.",
"I highly recommend playing Go Mecha Ball — just know that it’s more limited than it might seem on the surface. I’d probably feel better about the game if it were a short, linear experience with crafted levels instead of a roguelike, and in its current form, just a few small updates to add a bit of variety would be enough to pique my interest again. Even now, I’m certain that I’ll be dusting it back off in a few months when the experience isn’t so fresh in my mind. As a way to spend a few blissfully chaotic nights, it’s hard to do better than Go Mecha Ball, even if it falls a bit short of greatness.",
"Yes, it's a button-masher, but nobody does button-mashing quite as well as KOEI with Dynasty Warriors, and Strikeforce gets more important things right (great animation, fluid controls, good weapon variety, PSP-sized missions) than it gets wrong.",
"At this stage in the PlayStation Vita's life, the most important thing for Reality Fighters to be is, perhaps, a tech demo. In that sense, it is quite spectacularly impressive. Impressive enough to warrant a big purchase and plenty of game time? Probably not. It demonstrates exceptional potential though, and sometimes that can be enough.",
"Concord provides a highly enjoyable and satisfying FPS experience, but needs more time in the oven if it wants to succeed in the highly competitive hero shooter and live-service market.",
"Rainbow Skies is a decent turn-based RPG that follows the path and the legacy of its predecessor (Rainbow Moon), which means that the new game from SideQuest Studios is targeted towards a specific audience that doesn’t mind grinding for hours upon hours.",
This game is the closest to the original Jagged Alliance we got in the last two decades. It's a fun game but complexity is far below the standards of the original games in the series.,
"B.I.O.T.A had some problems that held it back. Its repetitive gameplay, playable characters feels the same, and headache inducing colors ruined my overall experience. For me, this wasn’t a game that can itch that NES or Gameboy Color nostalgia cravings but, I can see why this game can be perfect for others. It is easy to pick up and fun to play. I do wish that the developer can improve more and I will be looking forward on their next project.",
"I would enjoy SimCity any time, and veterans of this series will love SimCity Creator immensely, while newcomers will enjoy it even as they learn to play this unique city-building simulation. One caveat; I wouldn’t recommend this game if you do not have the time to invest.",
"A somewhat addictive action title that should please fans of the character and action gamers alike. The lack of replayability means you'll probably get your fill of the game in about a week, but it's definitely worth a playthrough.",
"The Thaumaturge is a very strange title, both intentionally and sometimes unintentionally as well. On the surface level, it's a dark, narrative-driven game filled with morally-ambiguous choices which will oftentimes influence specific events in the story.",
"As a pool game, Sports Bar VR nails it. It’s as close to the real thing as you can get without leaving your house. The other modes are variable though and while the setting is quite nice in VR, the package is a little thin right now. However, it gives you more than Hustle Kings VR but maybe less than you might have expected overall.",
"All that smooth music, along with the ""Uber"" and ""Super Uber"" combo tricks, will have you stumbling away from the console at 4 a.m., your fingers aching and your voice hoarse. [17 Oct 2003, p.L2T 20]",
"Close to the Sun has a huge potential. Supported by a technique of good quality, it however lacks dynamism. The fault of very slow movements and a gameplay that requires that we agree to walk to the discovery of clues more present to define an atmosphere, than to advance in the story. Not quite adventure game, not quite FPS either, it does not take clear enough direction to stand out. Nevertheless, it will satisfy the fans of the genre who do not have much to play at the moment.",
"Is it a perfect game? No, not really, but it is well-crafted with obvious care and attention to detail, netting a smooth and enjoyable experience with just enough addictive qualities in the gameplay to keep one coming back for more.",
"It's the best this series has been in a long while, and it does so by catering not to 2K fans, but basketball fans in general. The Jordan Challenges, MyNBA Era and MyPlayer modes all give a sense of wonder and fun the series lacked in the last three games. And in the next game (That needs to feature Kobe Bryant on the cover), this is the line they need to drive to.",
"One the one hand Monster Energy Supercross 25 is undoubtedly the best series' entry so far with better graphics, better physics and more tracks than ever before. But on the other hand that still does not mean the game could fully compete with the top games of the genre, not least because of the lack of varied gameplay and modes. A solid racing game mainly for a special target group.",
"The presentation is strong, and there are some genuine moments of surprise - most memorably a scene that shrinks your character down and places you on a life-sized pool table. [Feb 2004, p.109]",
"Maybe the best way to play Samorost 3 is to play with it, to think of it as a bizarrely-shaped thing that prompts one to appreciate the ways oddities can spark and delight the imagination. At least that’s the way I’ll continue to play it, curiously wandering through alien environments, turning each sight and sound over and over in my head, very much like I once did with a strange piece of wood I encountered when I was young.",
"Stronghold has always been a series that was pleasingly enjoyable to play and has always had bags of potential, but this recent rehash does nothing other than highlight just how out of date it has become.",
"The essential problem with Soldier of Fortune: Payback is that it tries very hard to appear realistic while trotting out silly gameplay mechanisms. It’s hard to tell if it’s a serious shooter covering the military side of contemporary politics, or a parody.",
"Once again, Signal Studios have succeeded in making a game that combines in a perfect way three genres in one enjoyable experience. It has its flaws in some aspects like in its online mode or presentation, but overall, it offers a really entertaining title that fans of strategic action and tower defense games should try it at least once.",
"It’s easy to see what Camel 101 was going for as it constructed Those Who Remain’s dark and foreboding world, but while the intent was noble, the execution leaves much to be desired. The game’s low price point might appeal to someone who’s desperate for a new game to play, but any wayward souls who come across the exit for Dormont while cruising the horror game highway should just keep on driving.",
"Juggling different weapons and dodging enemy fire makes the gameplay feel frantic and exciting, but too little enemy and level design variation hold this competent shooter back from greatness. [Apr 2011, p.96]",
"Insecticide had a lot of great things going for it (former developers from LucasArts, intriguing investigation sequences, a terrific art-style, and hilarious story), but ultimately the game comes down as a dire disappointment.",
"While AoM sports a new graphics engine and three unique factions, on the whole it plays very much like its predecessors. Too much like its predecessors, if you were hoping for a truly different game experience.",
"DOA Ultimate is just that, an ultimate DOA game that caters to the fans. It's not the pinnacle of fighting games but it looks great, plays awesome over Live with plenty of options, and is accessible to novices.",
"With new features, modes, and various quality of life upgrades from its mobile origins, Part Time UFO on Switch continues to exemplify the fun and quirky sensibilities of HAL Labs without losing a step or grip.",
"On one hand, there's a strong narrative featuring beautiful cinematics and atmospheric music to set the mood perfectly. On the other, you have clunky on-foot controls combined with frustrating gameplay.",
"Overall, this is a Forza Horizon game in every sense of the word, and shows off the best of what Horizon can be. It’s fun, only structured if you want it to be, and seems to exist purely to make sure you have a good time. What more could you want?",
"Pikuniku is a unique and stand out experience that makes you feel good to play it. It certainly isn’t for someone looking for action or a serious challenge, but those who want a relaxing game where you bounce around, kick things, and make friends will find a lot to like here.",
"I kind of feel like, with the popularity of the skater genre and the endless appeal of competitive shooters, a game like this was an inevitability. It’s too perfect a combination to not work, and I’m just glad Roll7 got to it first with Rollerdrome. This is an exceptional and welcoming game, one that takes the best elements from both genres and combines them into a sophisticated and unabashedly cool experience.",
"After years of mediocrity for AiAi and the crew, there was always the worry SEGA might drop the ball when it came to a Super Monkey Ball 20th anniversary celebration. Thankfully, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is a great remaster of the series’ best years packed full of content and given a handsome facelift. The major downgrade of the much-loved Monkey Target aside, there’s still plenty of fun to be had here fan or newcomer.",
"It would have been neat if all of the games in this collection could feature online multiplayer, but even without it, the titles still manage to be entertaining in single player or local co-op.",
"This standalone expansion to SUPERHOT is a welcome addition to the formula. What it lacks in bespoke puzzle elements, it makes up for in a completely fresh and vastly expanded approach to the central concept.",
"I fear my childhood has prevented me from giving Nebuchadnezzar a fair chance. It was never going to meet my expectations because I was holding it up to a level of quality that few have been able to match in the past 20 years. This isn't a bad game; it just not one that you'll remember in a year, forget a decade. So instead of recommending this, I recommend you instead spend half as much and buy Pharoah instead.",
"The dual-protagonist storytelling manages to be both compelling and original, the multiplayer is a guns-blazing good time, and the entire aesthetic (not just the graphics, mind you, but the art direction, music, and sound) will have you ordering up a good sarsaparilla in no time.",
"I really wanted more from Critter Café, but without any real narrative and no strong sense of purpose or progression, I quickly got bored of my time with the game. Running the café isn’t very fulfilling, and while completing the puzzles to rescue the critters is fun enough, if I want puzzles there are much better options out there. That’s not to say this is a bad game: it is cute, and there is fun to be had — it could just have been so much better.",
"I’ve absolutely loved playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and I’m happy to say that Square Enix once again delivered with this release. It’s a fantastic follow-up to Remake that expands the world of Final Fantasy VII even more, and it’s a sequel that shouldn’t be missed. Whether you’re a hardcore Final Fantasy VII fan, or someone that came on board via the Remake, you won’t be disappointed.",
Need for Speed Unbound is one of the best entries in the series since the golden days of Underground and Most Wanted. There are tons of new changes that give the game a unique spirit and the main focus on street racing combined with a generous vehicle list make this a solid arcade racing.,
"NSMBW gets a lot right, nailing the classic vibe while also evolving the series in some interesting ways, but a few flaws keep it from achieving the the sort of classic status enjoyed by Super Mario World and Super Mario Galaxy.",
"Meshing a well-told and captivating story with a strategic battle system, a bevy of collectable minions and a gorgeous world, Enchanted Arms is a great way to start of the JRPG tradition on the Xbox 360.",
"Rocksteady proved once again that they’re in a league of their own. Arkham Knight not only outclassed their two previous Batman games put together, but also turned the whole trilogy into a masterpiece. It’s not just a strong candidate for the Game of the Year title. It’s one of the best games of the decade. [08/2015, p.44]",
"Those who have played some of the other Sim City games will hardly find here a game capable of offering a new experience. If that’s not the case, Creator is an experience that will keep their interest points, although, neither the Wii control will works like would be predictable.",
"With the direct control system, insane level of detail and physics modeling, exciting and interesting missions, modding support, and incredibly fun gameplay, the game is hardly stale and makes it easy to recommend to players who are sick of playing ""Command & Conquer"" clones.",
"A must-have for fans of the Phoenix Wright series, as it is even better than those, and not very recommended for those who don't have much patience or don't like very much to read, as sometimes there is a lot of story to be told. Everyone who likes graphic adventure games should try it for its originality and surprising plot.",
"The big difference is the technical move forward. Action is fluid, special effects are pretty, and the cutscenes are funny and entertaining. Even the in-game physics, like building explosions and collapses, are comparable to first person shooters.",
"The tempo has been given a jump start but this is basically the same RTS we've been playing for years and years, which will undoubtedly please throngs of fans. This time around it's just more polished and presented in its most beautiful package to date.",
"Ultimately, I appreciate the vibrant and unique world that Krome Studios creates, and despite the substandard voice work, I enjoy Blade Kitten's wacky characters as well. However, aside from a few puzzles and boss battles, the gameplay fails to leave a lasting impression.",
"Although the game is still a good experience, every enjoyable aspect was brought with a caveat that diminished my enjoyment somewhat. It's a great idea, but its execution was not so much.",
"Dicefolk is the type of game we can see ourselves going back to again and again. It’s going to appeal to fans of deckbuilding roguelikes, but its Pokémon-like twist — and the fact you’re rolling dice instead of playing cards — helps it stand out from the crowd. It’s challenging but addictive, which just so happens to be the perfect combination for a game like this.",
Still has its brand of goofy appeal; there&#146;s nothing quite like the sight of stuffed animals pumping each other full of lead...Hardcore FPS fans and platform purists should stay away.,
"Forge is an ambitious mixture of genres--PVP and team FPS--but it's not polished enough and doesn't have quite enough content to work completely yet. Dark Vale has their work cut out for them making Forge a complete and intuitive experience, but the potential is there.",
"Saying Burning Skies is a bit too linear for its own good would be a little bit unfair since the FPS genre has become synonymous with heavily scripted and action packed events. But that's exactly what is missing in Burning Skies: the action. [June 2012, p.84]",
"Harmonix Music VR somewhat justifies its existence. Having a drawing app available for PlayStation VR out of the gate is nice, but everything beyond that is kind of pointless. 'The Trip's' kaleidoscope visuals are great for a couple of songs, and it's a wonderful starting point for VR beginners, but the remaining two experiences are redundant and unappealing.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is the ""best of"" all the series entries. Playground Games found the key to present the ginormous amount of content in a smooth way in one of the best open worlds ever made. Mexico is a magical, fascinating and adventurous place to drive in, and the glorious graphics of the game give us the real next gen experience we were looking for.",
"Boyfriend Dungeon is not only an enjoyable and inclusive dating sim dungeon crawler, but it’s also a thoughtful game on relationships. I had a nice time getting to know the variety of bladed partners, and I’m sure dating sim fans will enjoy it too. The Dunj delving might lack variety, but getting to know the characters is worth the effort. Whether you’re new to dating sims or a regular romancer, you’ll have a fun time in the dunj with your new fling.",
"It's really great when you get a game you feel is created specifically for your fan community, and I'm sure, to some extent, fans will appreciate this title. But I wish more effort was put into making Chaos Wars the quintessential JRPG fan game.",
"We feel like there’s a lot standing between you and the potential enjoyment to be hand in Paleo Pines. Its initial lack of direction can be frustrating, and there are some really questionable design choices that only serve to hinder you. Get past those obstacles, though, and playing Paleo Pines can be an enjoyable experience, allowing players plenty of freedom to play however they want to. Is it the best farming simulator out there? Certainly not. But it does have dinosaurs – and absolutely adorable ones at that.",
"For as great as Alan Wake's American Nightmare starts out, it ends in an unsatisfying, cliffhanger fashion. I loved the setting, loved the action, but felt Remedy didn't tell their story to the best of their abilities; confounding story twists, half-ideas and a quick resolution hold this game back from making an impact.",
It's like being given the keys to Disney World and finding out the majority of attractions are not operational; you're left in a magical place with little to do other than to go on the same few rides that happen to be working.,
"The fantasy sequences and overall visual style are truly a feast for the eyes, but this is little more than just a standard slash 'n' bash game in pretty clothing. [Christmas 2005, p.104]",
"Shadows: Awakening is a deep action RPG which brings a literal new dimension to the tried and tested Diablo format. It's a great choice for those looking for a meaty fantasy time-sink, and while it does stumble occasionally, it delivers many hours of engaging hack-'n'-slash gaming.",
"Although it conflates and confuses a lot of historical reality to conform to its alternative universe, Close to the Sun really impresses in a few key areas. It looks incredible and is founded on a solid story concept. Some of its puzzles, mechanics and pacing issues get it in the way and remind the player that moving through the world needs to be just as satisfying as looking at the world. Fans of “walking simulators” and BioShock will feel at home but Close to the Sun does a good job of creating its own identity despite the obvious influences.",
The third episode of Batman: The Enemy Within proves that Telltale still can produce great stories and develop interesting characters. The Fractured Mask gives us everything that the first season missed.,
"Onimusha: Warlords for Nintendo Switch is a delight. It looks and plays well, it’s fun, and the in-game achievement system – aptly named Honors – motivates the player to replay the game several times. On average, most will be able to complete the game in around four hours. Despite the short duration, the journey is a quality one and something you’ll want to replay. Hopefully, Capcom has plans to bring the rest of the Onimusha series to the Nintendo Switch in the near future.",
It's this sense of bike duty and absurd self-imposed goofiness (the game has a sunny and lighthearted side to complement its brutish exterior) that ultimately make this game the perfect '7.',
"Bloodline Champions is a deep and addictive online game. It's competitive PvP at its best and, if you're part of that group of players who constantly complains about balancing in games, you should definitely download it.",
"An alloy of several winning gaming formulas, combing great graphics, wonderful sound, and deep, engrossing game play. And though it may not appeal right away to those of short attention spans, given a chance, you&#146;ll find yourself being sucked into it, enjoying it to its fullest extent.",
Combine the impatience of others and the almost endless random item grind and I do not see a casual audience getting swept away in the Warhammer hype by this game. Even Warhammer fans should make note that just because you may know the lore of the series it won't grant you a wonderful team experience ... but it may grant you some street cred to get you by.,
"For all the careful planning that might go in a stickup, it all usually comes down to clutching out impromptu, split second shootouts. Sometimes these quirks manifest as incompetent A.I. behavior or exploitative gameplay, but for the most part, it all congeals in a remarkably tense and satisfying experience with depth to go with its style.",
"It is a small delight, then, to be able to replay Onimusha Warlords. In truth, it is an imperfect game that thoroughly shows its age (this is an enhanced port of the 2002 original to PS4, Xbox One and Switch, rather than a full-blooded remake like the upcoming Resident Evil 2), but a singular one that reminds you of its forgotten impact.",
"Mario & Sonic Sochi 2014 performs well and especially the Dream Events are fun. But it controls superficially and the explanation of events isn't explanatory enough. With a little more attention for the gameplay it could've earned gold. Or, well, silver at least.",
"There's enjoyment in the game's mechanics, in the way it hones your abilities until you're a taut, efficient, angel of death, but little joy to be found in the unraveling of your subconscious and the consequences of your new-found talents.",
"But behind the stunning visuals, the somehow very moving intro movie, and the bouncing breasts of the DOA girls lies a solid, addictive and extremely entertaining fighter that deserves a place in anybody's collection – and the Live modes are the icing on the cake.",
"Falls into the same sequel trap that many other games tumble into, where the emphasis in development is placed more on improving visual aspects rather than addressing flaws in the gameplay.",
"And the inclusion of Pac-Man Vs. is an absolute masterstroke of brilliance. That is a rare retro game, and finally having it readily available on a modern console is something that anyone who enjoys local multiplayer should get excited about.",
"Jupiter Hell is a tactical roguelike that is sure to find its fans, but will turn others away with its high difficulty and overly random reeling to each run. The lack of iterative improvements between runs made every failure feel overly punishing, though that's common in the with roguelikes. The end result is a game that I can appreciate, but didn’t really enjoy. Your mileage may vary of course, and if the idea of a fusion of Doom and XCOM appeals, then this may well be the game for you.",
"Enjoyable single-player campaign, fast and fun multiplayer skirmishes, great eye-candy… It's a pity that the game is so skimpy on the content. It'll take you just a couple of days to thoroughly explore Oil Rush.",
"Success or failure in Metroid Prime Pinball is down to little more than what day of the week it is; what modicum of skill that actually makes a difference is frequently undone by chance. With such a randomly uncontrollable element to the proceedings, you'll find yourself thinking this is either a really good addictive game, or the most infuriating thing since those Michael Winner commercials.",
"If you're on the lookout for a puzzle game that has a gripping story, a funny script and a cast of colourful characters that offers something a little different, Ghost Trick is a resounding success.",
"There aren&#146;t many puzzles in the game, which help to eliminate constant battling in RPGs, and therefore the game can become a repetitive - albeit enjoyable - hack and slash adventure, often leading to lower motivation to keep playing.",
"Certainly an improvement over its predecessor. By no means is it a perfect game as some of the technical issues did cast a shadow over the experience to a degree. That said, Stardock has been hard at work ironing out the wrinkles and the positives far outweigh the negatives.",
"While Criterion has successfully returned to the genre, it feels like the developer is being held back from delivering a truly colorful and over-the-top experience it's previously achieved in games like the Burnout series. The team should take the driving mechanics and the cartoony visual flairs from Need for Speed Unbound and turn those features up to the next level in their next arcade racer.",
"Tech Support: Error Unknown is a game with simple yet interesting gameplay and story with multiple endings. You start as a rookie tech support assistant but later in the game, you get more info and information about illegal activities on the network. Tech Support has a lot of problems like lack of explanation for some tasks and bugs, but it's overall a fun game.",
"Namco Museum on the Nintendo Switch offers a few arcade classics on the go but not really much else. The lack of online or even local multi-Switch play for all but one title, no real extras and the fact that the selection is kinda meager make this a pass for most people. It’s the absolute minimum to expect out of such a title.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles is exactly what it purports to be; simply the best way to play a beloved classic. A decade on, Xenoblade Chronicles is just as fantastic on Switch as the day it launched, despite some minor failings. Sure, it can get a bit ugly at times, and it's still a bit rough around the edges, but at the end of the day, between its gigantic quality-of-life changes and a fantastic new story chapter for long-time fans, there's little else you could ask for.",
"An amusing and little bit different minigamecollection. Gather some friends to play, though - it will be that much more fun. The shooting games are a nice addition for loners. [Jan 2008]",
"Even though the genre may be quite saturated these days, this is a great option. It's fun, deep, mature and different. There are some issues with the AI and it's not extremely different from its previous episodes, but if that's not a problem, you'll probably enjoy this new adventure.",
"Chaos Wars is not a great game, but it is fun. I felt let down by O~3's low-budget localization, and the last few hours of gameplay really felt dragged out, but otherwise I enjoyed the experience.",
"Commandos: Origins plays like a true sandbox experience. Here, the player must come up with their own solutions and overcome obstacles. At all times, the game encourages experimenting with different ways to tackle each challenge—and most importantly, to think through every move.The missions are well-designed and the enemies are intelligently placed, making the return of Commandos a compelling and challenging entry in the real-time tactics infiltration genre. That said, the game does have some technical shortcomings, particularly when it comes to controls and certain gameplay mechanics.",
"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate is a more robust, refined version of Team Ninja’s work on Dead or Alive 5, providing a fighting-game package that’s a better starting point for players new to this iteration of the series. Current Dead or Alive 5 owners, however, will have to pony up the exact same amount of scratch to join in on the fun.",
"After Us is difficult to recommend for its platforming alone, though its nature-focused kitsch gives way to gorgeous visuals as you breathe life back into its post-apocalyptic world. Some of its levels left a grin on my face, whereas others had me begging for sweet release from the inconsistent controls and directionless world. At least there’s a silver lining in that its beautiful art direction and entrancing musical score make for some really cool sequences. And yet I can’t help but feel like After Us is too heavy-handed about its environmentalist themes for a video game that hardly characterizes its protagonist and has literally no dialogue. By the end, I felt like I’d have done less environmental damage had I simply chosen to skip it.",
"Life is Strange fails to execute in critical spots, but it's beautiful world, fun time-reversal, and honest look at adolescence makes it a game worth remembering. A diamond in the rough.",
"Perfectly competent in execution, yet lacking that spark that makes us visibly excited to cough up yet more money for almost exactly the same Pokémon game as the last forty-four when Diamond and Pearl land over here.",
"Everblue 2 has terrific diving scenes, and you may find yourself enjoying that aspect over and over while forgetting about the actual missions, but tries to blend them into a story that is not that solid nor well told.",
"Sherlock Holmes-The Devil’s Daughter is born from below, affected by a quite limited financial investment, which can be seen through its weak technical part. Yet, it has tried to remedy to this lack by offering an excellent gaming variety, with a less linear and more compelling progress. It is a small but necessary step forward for this franchise.",
"There may be a lot of first person puzzle games on the market, but this has something that warms the soul. The world is interesting, the puzzles are challenging, and there's always something to see.",
"Legions of Steel is a recreation of the classic tabletop game from the 90s. It excels at conveying the original feel of the game thanks to its well implemented mechanics. At its core, Legions of Steel is a tactical turn-based action experience that rewards the top quality strategist. It may display a simplistic appearance, but Legions of Steel is a challenge for veterans of the genre.",
"I highly recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in fighting games, especially those who were disappointed with ""Tekken 4"" or people who have a craving for the Mortal Kombat series.",
"Jupiter Hell isn’t afraid to wear its inspirations on its sleeve, and it does a great job in recreating that ‘DOOM’ feeling in a vastly different genre. While the build and class diversity is solid at first glance, the lack of gameplay and level variety doesn’t provide that ‘one more run’ feeling. That being said, there is plenty for hardcore strategists to sink their teeth into should they want to master the game at the highest difficulty.",
"Gears of War 2 is one big roller coaster ride full of impressive moments. When the ride ends, there’s still the vast array of multiplayer possibilities to be discovered. The core gameplay of Gears of War remains intact, and some minor bugs I encountered lower the score a little bit, but don’t let that keep you away of this shining masterpiece.",
"For players looking for something a little outside the usual fare, Sorry We’re Closed is the offbeat survival horror genre-blend they didn’t know they’d been waiting for — and as one of that number myself, I can say that it was an experience unlike any other.",
"Funny co-op action in a dark world of original Warhammer is necessary to play with real teammates. The game concept is borrowed from elsewhere, but devs added their own innovations and with an efficient team, playing Vermintide brings a great and gory pleasure.",
"ArmA III has kept me busy for months, and its final version made me feel ambivalent. On one hand we have a great technological leap, on the other - poor content. Sure, ArmA III isn't your regular shooter that needs to have an interesting, long campaign - it's a game that lives through the community - but it's a pity, that the gamers were given so little to work on. Arma III was supposed to be great, and right now is only promising.",
"Short, cute, enjoyable games created with simplicity in mind and offset by a few bugs and an ultimately empty feeling. As it is you will find much to like here, just don’t expect it to last.",
"Don't let the scattered execution snafus be of great concern: Darksiders II is remarkably well put together, particularly in light of its impressive scope. Bigger doesn't mean better, of course, but this isn't a ""more of the same, just bigger"" kind of sequel.",
"Minis on the Move joins other greats like Pushmo to make the 3DS an amazing platform for anybody who enjoys a good puzzle game. Check it out, and prepare to get addicted to sliding tiles and frantically saving minis from a plunge into the dark abyss.",
"Technically a good game, but what prevents it from being a great one is its lack of legs. The sense of accomplishment one gets from conquering season after season loses a bit of its shine when confronted with the same eight tracks and the same stiff AI, creating a lack of real replay value if there isn’t a stable of friends to multi with.",
"Dropping the tactical experience of the Chronicles series, this spinoff opts for a darker take on war, focusing on swordplay and subterfuge in a tale of revenge that will forever shape the future of Europa.",
"Current lag issues notwithstanding, I would recommend Shadowrun Chronicles to anyone who enjoys the Shadowrun universe and enjoys turn-based strategy games. If you liked Shadowrun Returns, you'll probably also enjoy Chronicles, although you won't find the same depth of story just yet. The developers at Cliffhanger promise much more story that will be molded by the players as time goes on.",
"For a contemporary take on the Sim City formula, CitiesXL 2012 is probably the best option around. Just be aware that it holds this title by virtue of being pretty much the only option around.",
"The Thaumaturge is a slow, text heavy caper that is often curious and sometimes captivating, weaving revolutionary labor politics and mysticism together to create a unique and charming piece of historical science fiction. It is eurojank through and through, filled with criss-crossing systems like gathering observations, Thaumaturge abilities, and combat that are all fun and engaging despite the sometimes hitchy controls, clunky conversations, and odd voice overs that make this journey a bumpy one. But if a little jank didn’t stop you from enjoying RPGs like Vampyr or The Witcher, you’ll be well equipped for this otherwise exciting ghost story.",
"From a apparently simple mechanic, this game will evolve becoming something very addictive and challenging. The different modes and the ability to create and share levels will bring us many hours of fun.",
"Puzzles, episodes and a lot of action. Revelations 2 doesn’t want to be the next summer blockbuster like the last iterations of the Resident Evil series, it’s a very nice zombies game.",
"High Hell will easily speak to every fan of the old-school FPS of the 90's. Thanks to its absurd design, Devolver's new game tastes like a nice trip of acid. The only downside to the formula is indubitably its short length, but we will gladly take those two hours of pure fun.",
"Joyful and strange, Wattam’s a hard game to explain, but not a difficult one to play. Once it wraps you in its welcoming arms you won’t want to let go. Until you end up kaboomed, that is. [Issue#171, p.90]",
"Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time manages to capture the essence of the anime brilliantly. There’s plenty of fun to be had exploring Luna Nova as well as all the various dungeons. Some slow story pacing and frame rate drops let things down slightly, but if you’re a fan of the series, you should definitely pick this up.",
"Starship Troopers: Extermination is a wonderfully straightforward and refreshingly blunt horde shooter whose biggest stars are its gigantic alien hordes. Numerous unlockables, reasonably varied classes, diverse locations and at least four game modes provide enough motivation to get that extra round in. The typical Starship Troopers tone, the iconic bug design and the brutal action are certainly convincing, even if the direct competition Helldivers 2 is the recognizably better game in all respects. Nevertheless, Starship Troopers: Extermination is fun - also because the base-building with a slight tower defense twist is a good addition to the simple but solid game principle. Extermination's biggest problems are the server-side performance and the numerous game bugs, which get on your nerves over time.",
"Fans of Japanese RPGs should bear in mind that behind the problems lies an extremely competent, if not terribly imaginative, RPG which will certainly fill a couple of dozen hours of your time in an entertaining and involving manner.",
"South of Midnight is one of the greatest gems of this generation, a design that takes us back to the days of the PS3, with spectacular graphics, easy-to-learn gameplay and a lot of fun that flows at a good pace. It's a title to enjoy and cherish.",
"The boss battles and platforming challenges vary just enough, and the minigames (such as the side-scrolling shooter level and the ""Excitebike""-inspired motorcycle race) are great. [Dec 2003, p.104]",
"While many of the main gameplay mechanics remain like the original, many smaller changes have been made to improve the overall gameplay experience. The UI is wonderful and the varied faction mechanics allow for a good amount of replay ability. There are plenty of joyous empire building moments to be had in Endless Space 2 and it also contains a good level of strategic depth especially in multiplayer.",
"It doesn’t matter if you're a fan of the movie, comics, or action games in general. Iron Man has little to offer but the pain of aneurysm-inducing frustration and disgust for the greedy underbelly of our lifestyle.",
"I plan on playing more Heroes VI, and if you've enjoyed past Heroes game, you're going to enjoy this one, too. But it'd be nice to see Ubisoft try more new things and ditch their lousy online strategy.",
"Killer is Dead has an excellent technical department, but it's short duration, alongside certain graphic issues, prevent it from sticking out of the crowd. Fans of Suda 51 will love it, while the rest may very well hate it or just be overwhelmed by it's particular gameplay.",
"Stronghold Crusader 2 delivers exciting RTS battles and is a fun castle-building simulation, which challenges the player every single match. Despite this, the game is disappointing in many other areas, and because of that we yearned numerous times for its predecessor.",
"Diablo II: Resurrected presents the very best version of an all-timer, and benefits from all of the patches and updates it received from Blizzard in the early part of this century. Stuff that helped fine tune an already great game, turning it into something that stands the test of time.",
"If you crave a digestible and portable puzzle-based diversion, look no further than HAL's Box Boy. Its outright friendliness helps combat the patience-testing nature of most puzzle games, and those minutes-long levels allow players to make some degree of progress, even if they don't have much time to spare.",
"If taking to space in a starfighter built to send murderous bandits into the cold vacuum of space is your idea of a good time, then Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is certainly worth considering.",
"There's a very limited, repetitive number of enemy types (whose quickly depleted voiceovers get annoying), and the core combat is solid, but uninspired (circle-strafe, reload, repeat).",
"Root Double: Before Crime * After Days Xtend Edition is a stellar story full of incredible twists and well-explored themes. It's just a shame that it hits a few bumps as it gets to those moments. Mind-numbing exposition dumps, vague narrative decisions, and some inconsistent pacing sour the experience a fair bit. Even so, there's an incredibly memorable visual novel experience here as long as you've got the patience for some nagging issues.",
"NCAA 06 only sees release in the US, which is unfortunate because it is arguably the best gridiron experience on offer gameplay wise - the game feels alive and completely random, and while this can at times become a negative for realism sake, it still makes for some truly awesome gameplay.",
"It's still a fantastic game that follows in the footsteps of great Russian-style FPS games before it, and the added polish, fantastic visuals, and supernatural story elements help keep things fresh.",
"The Expanse: A Telltale Series is a welcome return for the celebrated company. Although the first episode is particularly short, it sets up an intriguing story that requires no prior knowledge of the franchise, yet will please fans of the show. Several refinements improve the gameplay, however, it doesn’t stray too far away from conventions of the genre. Most importantly though, the world, the characters and the story are fascinating and due to this, I am excited for future episodes.",
"Rollerdrome is an incredible arcade shooter that combines fluid movement with addicting mechanical loops which encourage you to pull off visually appealing stunts with ease. Though your mileage may vary be you a high-score chaser or not, it never fails to be fun, and Rollerdrome is more than worth a look for any arcade shooter lover.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is the best playing version of the annual soccer sim in quite some time, with more intelligent artificial intelligence and weather physics adding a layer of density and dynamism to the experience – albeit largely offline. To us, Ultimate Team feels like it’s getting a bit stale, but we like the addition of Rush across the entire release, which offers something a little different for when you fancy a change of pace. And while the commentary and menus are below par, the overall quality of the presentation continues to be underappreciated.",
"Riptide’s flaws are many, but they couldn’t hold me back from having a blast. Few games nail the visceral feel of melee combat and co-op fun like Dead Island. At its worst, an annoying hiccup breaks the immersion of the grizzly trek through a zombie-infested paradise. At its best, Riptide hits the same high notes as the original.",
"Rainbow Skies is an indie old school SRPG hiding a wealth of content behind its charming exterior. Improving upon the Rainbow Moon formula, the game doesn’t skimp out on quality or quantity, featuring extensive party management, in-depth combat, a vast world to explore, and a myriad of foes to conquer. Unfortunately, the hundreds of hours of gameplay are not free from tedium and suffer from a lack of variety.",
"Need for Speed Unbound is the best arcade racer of 2022, and a real statement from EA and Criterion. Why it’s snuck out with so little fanfare will be one of the mysteries of the year.",
"An extremely approachable game that has a strong foundation for those who are willing to stick with it for the long haul, despite the fact that it tends to wear a bit thin at present due to the vagaries of its random events and a difficulty level that tends to be too easy or too hard, with very little middle ground for experienced players.",
"A solid trip down memory lane for fans of the original NES game. But is that trip worth $20? Probably not. If Excitebike had been part of a larger compilation of NES classics, it would be much more welcome.",
"Sega proves that they still have what it takes to make a Sonic title that feels fun, fresh and quite frankly fantastic, here's hoping that they can replicate this success in the future.",
"Even fans of the comic won’t have fun with this piece. At the beginning, the permanent explosions are quite entertaining, but soon they get as boring as the monotony of a firing machine gun. No, thanks!",
"Firefall has potential, but it’s not quite there just yet. A little bit more restructuring and beefing up in some areas will help Firefall evolve, if Red 5 Studios can give more time and money to the project. Hopefully it keeps developing the title, as it does have potential.",
"Ronin is a really good independent production. Well thought-out mechanics, challenging gameplay and nice visuals make it hard to stop playing, and the interesting ending will surely bring a satisfying smile.",
"A steep learning curve, specific source material and an overall feel that doesn't exactly scream mass market means the game probably won't have the universal appeal that Incog&#146;s previous efforts had, but given enough time, it's more than easy enough to warm to the game&#146;s plusses.",
"Another blockbuster movie, another movie tie-in game. Time and time again we’re treated to hastily produced games designed to cash in on a movie that’s attracted attention in the mainstream media. Iron Man is no exception to this rule, and even though there are some qualities to be found here the overall experience is a lackluster one.",
"A cursory glance at Dragon Throne often urges people to write it off as an ""Age of Empires"" clone. However, it is a sophisticated RTS title and handles its many layers much better than comparable RTS titles.",
"My experience with Age of Mythology was one of apathy and boredom... Think of AoM as Led Zeppelin&#146;s ""Stairway to Heaven."" Sure, it&#146;s a great song, but do you really want to hear it over and over again?",
"The missions themselves begin to feel repetitive and some can be overly challenging... Still, with over 25 levels and internet multiplay through Microsoft's Gaming Zone, StarLancer is a great space combat game.",
"One of those games that keeps you coming back to finish it despite it&#146;s simplistic gameplay, due mostly to clever puzzle design. It uses a simple formula that provides straightforward action and adventure elements in a spooky, but kid-friendly setting.",
"While it's complexities edge a tad too close to convolution at times, 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII' was a great time once I wrapped my head around it all. The steps towards accessibility, while far from perfect, definitely make this the most user-friendly entry in the series, and the amount of options available to players is hugely appreciated.",
"A strong action RPG title that, due to a meticulous and inflexible storyline, is sadly at times as impenetrable as a remake of ""Van Helsing"" cast by the Goons from ""Popeye."" [JPN Import]",
"The learning curve is steep, the controls take effort to master, and the single-player game is ultimately there to prepare you for head-to-head matches. It’s a very specific game experience that rewards trial and error and fails to appeal to a broad audience in the process.",
"Pac is back with its first PlayStation adventure. This time the yellow fellow must save his family across six worlds, full of danger and (obviously) ghosts. A nice platform game for young and nostalgic players.",
"Unless you are a die-hard on-rails shooter fan it's quite hard to recommend Yar's Revenge over some of the much more loved classics on Xbox Live, like the brilliant REZ. Yar's Revenge is the exact opposite of Mizugichi's masterpiece as it lacks the memorable moments and set pieces. This re-imagining of a classic isn't what it could have been.",
"Hunt the Night is an incredibly challenging and fun action game. Progression relies heavily on the player’s skill and understanding of enemy attack telegraphs to avoid damage. Sure, you’ll die a lot, but the knowledge gained from each encounter will keep you alive until the boss fights. Puzzle also has some depth to them, requiring players to be immersed in the world to solve the trials. Luckily, this is easy, thanks to the detailed lore found throughout the game world.",
"A very engaging and original puzzler, Crush presents unique gameplay and stages that grow increasingly more complex, but never too difficult. While the controls could be a bit tighter and there could be more environments, it’s still a fun experience from start to finish.",
"Despite projecting a tendency for high speed, only after the intensive adaption process to the turning and cornering is conquered coupled with the disposition to go through many falls will players be able to achieve some fun and compensation. Even with few play modes, Moto GP08 manages to be a good experience for fans.",
"Close to the Sun is one game I can still recommend for anyone who enjoys these slower type of adventure games. It won’t be the best atmospheric game you have come across, and I feel it’s a title that only needs to be played once, but that doesn’t stop the game from offering a fascinating setting and dazzling atmosphere.",
"NBA 2K23 is still the best possible product for basketball fans and the best thing you can ask for in a sports simulation game. The additions of historical content are jaw-dropping and have clearly received plenty of love. However, the online experience that makes the game so long lasting is highly compromised by the absurd need to spend even more to stay in the competition.",
"Despite a few bugs the game plays so intense it at times feels like it's playing in your mind and not on your screen. It will make you feel really badass one second, only to disgust you with its over-the-top violence in the next. A few strange design choices interrupt the flow but all in all, Hotline Miami is a special experience not to be missed.",
"South of Midnight is a powerful and charming adventure about the healing power of empathy. Its well-written and thoughtful narrative is backed up by a beautiful art style and a tactile sense of place that makes it impossible not to be drawn into its fantastical, though often harrowing, world. Though the combat isn’t quite as slick as it could be, especially compared to the tight platforming and level design that encourages exploration at almost every turn, it’s still well worth the price of admission, especially considering it will be on Game Pass at launch. The only baffling omission from the package is the lack of New Game+ to mop up the floofs and journal entries you’ll inevitably miss. What I’m trying to say is that I already want an excuse to play through South of Midnight again, and that’s probably the highest praise I can give it.",
"Hydroventure: Spin Cycle is a great physics puzzle game, but the overall value seems a bit reduced by the uncomfortable use of the 3DS hardware. However, fans of the genre should really check it out.",
"Every minute that you play, you constantly feel as if you&#146;re discovering something new and different, and the game&#146;s puzzles feel very organic, intelligent, and open-ended, forcing you to think and rethink your strategy as you make new realizations about your place in the world.",
"The online aspect is extremely well done and probably makes Dead or Alive Ultimate one of the best Xbox Live games currently available. This, plus the addition of over 100 unlockable costumes, a huge gallery, and other goodies, definitely makes this the ultimate Dead or Alive game.",
"For the first time since Bionicle Heroes Traveller’s Tales didn’t have to stick to an external license, but could let their fantasy run wild in an open world. The result is a little shallow in terms of mechanics, but makes up for it with bucket loads of humor in the tradition of the early Zucker/Abrahams spoofs.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a brutal, beautiful delight. Its elegant parry system, demonic boss battles, and flexible yet approachable take on character development have come together to create a package that may pull directly from many sources in the genre but ultimately delivers a standout experience that easily stands amongst the stiffest competition the genre has to offer. Its early hours may suffer from linearity, and its parry-heavy combat system may not sit well with everyone, but if you’re up for the challenge and willing to adapt to how The First Berserker: Khazan requires you to play, then you’re in for an absolute treat.",
"There’s a good game under all the rubble and perplexing business decisions (such as not giving it out in PS Plus Extra), but why should you put up with all these frustrations when the game doesn’t a have distinct identity and there are better alternatives available for free right now?",
"The Framed Collection is a beautiful experiment in interactivity. The heist-comic book premise permeates every inch of these games from puzzles to story to art. A few puzzles didn't quite land for me, but the tight pacing and variety in complexity kept me engaged until the end that came too soon.",
"Biomotor Unitron seems like an awesome mecha-building RPG that draws inspiration from some of our favourite classic games, but in reality it’s a shallow curiosity with a fair share of charm to sink an afternoon or two into and not much more. The pieces are here – in fact, we’d love to see a Biomotor Unitron-like game made with modern sensibilities – but the motivation to motor on through the monotonous random battles to rank up in the arena depends wholly on how much you’ll enjoy some vivid sprites and catchy retro tunes.",
"Jurassic World Evolution looks great on my TV, and while it’s perfectly serviceable in handheld mode, there’s definitely a graphical hit—everything looks much fuzzier. Depending on what scenario you’re playing in, you’ll hear some famous legacy voices, most notably Jeff Goldblum introducing the game and chiming in every now and then to give a warning about whatever the project division heads are suggesting. I really enjoy Jurassic World Evolution, despite my historical distaste for city/park sims. I’m sure this is mostly due to the dinosaurs themselves, but it’s also not overly complicated.",
"An intriguing set but one that is downplayed significantly due to the controls. Your tolerance may vary though, so it's not a bad idea to rent this one to get the full experience for yourself before buying.",
"Unfortunately, the package ends up feeling a bit bare. The story is window dressing, and the gameplay is lacking in variety. The lack of multiplayer also feels like a missed opportunity. Without it, there’s not much replayability other than an online leaderboard.",
"Delivers everything you could possibly want in a role-playing game; it has a deep story, a ton of quests, great graphics and a brand new combat system. It's one of the few games where you can actually say that it's well worth the wait!",
"After 7 years of waiting, the new Crusader game is released. Stronghold Crusader II contains all the cool features from the original Stronghold Crusader game with some new and fun gameplay.",
"Concord is too daring a gamble for Firewalk and PlayStation Studios, who are releasing a 100% multiplayer pay-to-play game in a pool of already famous free-to-play games. While the game isn't fundamentally bad, it's slower and less dynamic than its rivals, which will hold some players back, and in no way revolutionizes the genre, which might have justified the entry fee. The game aims to be that “hero-shooter for casuals par excellence”, but does this genre have a place in today's ecosystem, and a paying one at that? Unfortunately, it's hard to see a bright future for Concord without some radical rethinking.",
"While definitely not for every gamer, FIFA Street 2 is a very solid entry into the realm of arcade sports and fans of the genre are sure to have a good time – once they get a handle on the control scheme, that is.",
"Knights and Bikes is an unique and genuine experience that was engaging from beginning to end. It’s a great example of a high quality co-op game. Thematically and mechanically, the game succeeds in highlighting cooperation. Foam Sword successfully delivers a great title that manages to be both fun and artistically inventive. Knights and Bikes is highly recommended for those looking for a captivating cooperative game to play with a friend.",
"New Super Mario Bros. Wii demonstrates one more time why Nintendo are masters of the all-ages gaming market, relevant and refreshing but at all times reverent and above all, incredible fun.",
"Playing against a pal or three isn't truly any less repetitive and tiresome than the endless sequence of door breaches and fire-and-forget gun battles that define the single-player experience, but it's at least different enough to add some middling interest to a game with little in reserve.",
"I’m glad I can still enjoy games like this. I love aggressive and gritty adventures as much the next guy, but being able to laugh at silly cartoon characters while figuring out addictive and clever puzzles assures me that I haven’t completely become a crotchety old cynic.",
"Need for Speed Unbound is a pleasant surprise, one of the best releases of the year and also one of the best and boldest games in the series. It's an easy recommendation for any racing games fan and we hope that EA and Criterion continue to improve the formula delivered with this title.",
"As the basis for a full-on action game, Castlevania: Judgment might have worked, but the dull arenas, limited enemy monsters, and horrible storytelling means that we're only left with a poor fighting game instead.",
"A game that plays you with its unique sanity effects, that forces you to adapt to over a dozen characters and that holds no punches when it comes to the horror of Lovecraftian agents plotting out demise, Eternal Darkness will be a significant milestone in gaming for years to come.",
The type of game that tends to get over praised since its simplicity and competency are so refreshing. But you don't have to be an Astro Fan-Boy to appreciate the throwback fun of this well-made shooter.,
Nothing but a copycat of the original Tropico game comes with small arrangements like a road building system or 3D visuals. Yet it is a catchy and reliable “dictatorship” game. [Nov 2009],
"Need for Speed Unbound is the best modern NFS to date. It is still riddled with issues like rubberbanding and weird drifting physics, but it still provides its players with the best handling system in years, with grip racing finally back. With the best visual design NFS has ever had and some interesting campaign decisions, it gives hope that the series is back on track to becoming something great.",
"Even though the similarities between Vermintide and the L4D series are literally everywhere, Fatshark managed to pull out an astonishing feat by delivering a heavily entertaining title. The grim atmosphere of the Warhammer universe is properly delivered and the gameplay is accessible and familiar to most. The downsides are the lack of dedicated servers and the somewhat imbalanced loot roll system. We are eager to see what are the future plans for Fatshark's new born child.",
"The Groundhog Day of tile-based fantasy RPGs, Loop Hero is a unique, highly addictive and well-crafted roguelike that will have you saying, “just one more loop.” If this mix of genres intrigues you, I highly recommend you check the game out.",
"Although some may have fun with Rabbids: Alive and Kicking, the overall package is far from optimal. When your load times last longer then your mini games that poses a major issue. If you were looking at buying this game because you enjoyed the Rabbids games that are on the Wii, Alive and Kicking kicking doesn't live up to the bar set out before it.",
"At the end of the day Fusion Frenzy 2 is a fun game for the whole family, but the bland character design, non-existent plot and the overall obnoxious voice-overs really hurt this title more than they should.",
"The new single-player story mode and bonus games add a little more longevity to the game, the fundamental experience is still largely the same as that offered in previous Mario Party games. If you bought ""Mario Party 4"" last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.",
"With some lacklustre mission design (shoot enemies, find keycode, go through door, repeat) and an even flatter multiplayer mode, Ghost in the Shell feels like a wasted opportunity like ""Coded Arms"" before it. [PSW]",
"Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is as strange as you'd expect it to be from reading the title. Although is offers decent platforming action, it effectively tries to prevent you from having fun with it in every way. Monotonous, illogical design choices and other annoying aspects make this rabbit jump to mediocre heights.",
"New gameplay and presentation tweaks and the all-new online franchise are welcomed with open arms, but disappointments from The Extra Point, online co-op, and the commentary don't make it the greatest Madden game ever.",
"The narratively profuse mystery game Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is like living in a Bikini Kill song followed by a Phoebe Bridgers ballad. The D.I.Y. riot grrrl essence here is inspiring, especially for those who lived through the time.",
"One of the best stories the medium has ever seen, memorable characters that really matter, a refined combat system that is amplified with great new ideas, living open worlds that are constantly surprising you and of course, an authentic audiovisual presentation. scream, make Final Fantasy VII Rebirth not only the most serious candidate to win the Game of the Year title in 2024, but also one of the most outstanding representatives of its genre in all of history. No, I'm not exaggerating. We are facing one of the best action RPGs of this wonderful form of entertainment, which of course is saying a lot if one considers everything that has been done in the past. Square Enix has hit a home run that even left the stadium and, for its part, the PS5 scores a new exclusive that undoubtedly cures what Sony's own internal studios are not doing.",
"A good action game with some really inspired moments. The campaign now is less open-world but better-crafted. The greatest and biggest loss in this game is the co-op mode, but the multiplayer is still very addictive, especially now with all the unlockables.",
Endless Space 2 is a glorious (and graphically awesome) iteration of the tired 4X formula. There are some interesting innovations that can lead the genre a little further together with some quirks in the interface that can lead to frustration for the more advanced players.,
"Have you ever been rewarded for ripping 250 guys in half with your bare hands? You will be while playing this game, and if that's not reason enough to buy it, then I really don't know what is.",
"Once Human offers a world full of strange creatures that's refreshingly unique in the survival MMO genre, but that world is populated by derivative gameplay and boring combat and never matches the potential of its premise.",
"All this in service of a tale that effortlessly juggles lighthearted humour with careful traversal of serious, difficult themes like domestic violence, while building to an especially emotional conclusion. A Space for the Unbound is an enchanting, sometimes confronting dive into a slice of Indonesian history, and a journey will worth taking.",
"EA Sports FC 25 has been the game that has received the most serious development among the football games released in recent years. The depth that FC IQ adds to the game and the revolution made in tactical sense will give great pleasure especially for those who like to read the game from the sidelines. However, it should not be forgotten that this is ultimately an EA Sports football game, if it can maintain the same pleasure after a patch or two, EA FC 25 can successfully write its name in the history of football games.",
"Sorry We’re Closed is a remarkable fusion of punk aesthetics, survival horror mechanics, and deeply authentic character-driven storytelling. Its unapologetic blend of style and substance, from its diverse cast to its unique visual flair, makes it a standout in a genre often dominated by darker, more serious tones.",
"The Calm Before The Storm is probably a better title. The third episode of Telltale’s second season of Batman isn’t big on action, massive shocks, or set-pieces, but it is big on character development, interaction, making choices, and probably making the wrong ones. Fractured Mask isn’t the most eventful episode, but it’s still fun, all the characters are clashing wonderfully, and it’s fun waiting for the hammer to fall and your choices to bite you hard. Which will probably happen in Episode 4. We can’t wait.",
"I would highly recommend checking this out if you're looking for an original indie experience. I tend to criticize games when they make me run around in circles, but I'm more than willing to make an exception for Loop Hero.",
"Immortal’s pursuit of the hardcore label speaks to a certain presumptiveness in its design – that its impenetrable nature will be offset by a community looking for new challenges to overcome and new mysteries to unravel. Dark Souls got away with that approach because every aspect of it was so meticulously fine-tuned. Immortal’s extreme difficulty only highlights how fundamentally its ideas don’t run together. If there’s anything worse than a bad game, it’s a hostile bad game.",
"The game does not innovate with anything, other than the multiplayer aspect. However, New Super Mario Bros. Wii lives up to its pedigree and provides an amazing experience reminiscent of older Mario platformers.",
"Shovel Knight Showdown proves that Yacht Club Games is capable of making more than just platformers, as it’s delivered an entertaining and content-rich multiplayer brawler that’s sure to be a house favourite to many. Plenty of game modes, a long cast of characters, and a bevvy of unlockables ensure that this is a release that you’ll be playing for quite some time – although we would add that it’s a game which is best enjoyed with others on hand. Though single-player options are present, they fail to provide enough of a reason to justify this release as a standalone product, and we’d sooner direct you to one of the other Shovel Knight campaigns if you intend on mostly playing alone. Either way, Yacht Club Games continues to impress with its support for Shovel Knight, and we’d highly recommend you experience Shovel Knight Showdown one way or another.",
"The only thing more difficult than making a revolution is to re-make a revolution. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE is still a fun shooter, based on innovative and intriguing ideas, but no longer as effective as they had been in 2016. The roguelite approach certainly gives the game a more conspicuous length, but on the other hand ends up watering down at least part of the mechanics, making the overall experience less incisive than that of the original chapter. After all, as SUPERHOT has always taught, reality is all about perception.",
"Though playing through the main story doesn't take nearly as long as I'd like, level replays plus a two-player sabotage mode (two DS cards needed) lengthen gameplay. [Dec 2005, p.122]",
"Although its grim presentation and hearty challenge won't be for everybody, Hotline Miami is a rare game that articulates its own design thesis not only thoroughly, but with palpable enthusiasm. Underneath its moody graphics, stellar sound design and masterfully tuned combat is a strong feeling that this game's creators love making video games.",
"Given that it actually came out before ""Hour Of Darkness"" in Japan, it'll come as no surprise that this is marginally the weaker of the two titles but what has taken us aback is both how different the game feels and how dangerously close it actually is in terms of quality.",
"Digital Extremes has done a fairly good job with bringing a new IP to life, while not the AAA title that many expected, it's an incredibly solid action game with gorgeous graphics, intense combat, and a story that if done right could go places in a sequel.",
"Minor issues aside, Grip: Combat Racing is a great experience for both veterans of arcade combat racers as well as those who are willing to learn the genre. The initial learning pains and massive difficulty spikes toward the end of the game may turn away newcomers, and the catch-up mechanics and sometimes questionable physics may dissuade veteran players. For all others, though, Grip is a wild ride that offers fantastic tracks that are exhilarating to race on at lightning-fast speeds.",
"Highly frustrating missions pepper the game, usually filled with cheap enemies who have impeccable aim and a superhuman ability to absorb multiple shotgun blasts at point-blank range. [Apr 2004, p.116]",
"Criminal Girls: Invitation Only starts off very lackluster with rather baffling gameplay choices, but after unlocking more skills that improve the battles drastically, dungeon crawler fans can easily find a lot of fun here.",
"A good game, but it has some deep flaws. Is not made for everyone, mixes too much genres and its argument could be better focused but, still, it is an entertaining adventure that can be followed with great interest.",
"So this is a very short review, but since the developer doesn't have enough respect for players or the source material to include a core part of the original experience, I'm going to show them as much respect in return.",
"Football fundamentals matter now. Successful plays come from knowing the situation, calling the right play, making a good pre-snap read, and then executing -- the same criteria that determines the outcome in a real game.",
"Concord fails to capture the hearts of players, whether due to its conceptual flaws or its lack of personality. The characters are forgettable, and the game modes can quickly become repetitive.",
"While it does lack some of the polish of Nintendo's best, Sonic Colors is very, very good and offers enough truly unique features to sit at the table and hold its own. Welcome back, Sonic – we've missed you.",
"Wattam takes the concepts of action and puzzling, and makes them its own. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all of the wacky and strange characters that Funomena has conjured up. Starting with the lonely mayor and ending with an entire community of over 100 playable characters is a very satisfying progression. However, Wattam doesn’t provide the extra layer of gameplay that I found myself yearning for.",
"So much effort went into replicating the glaive's flight and awe-inspiring kills that every other aspect of Dark Sector took a noticeable hit in quality and polish, save for the visuals. Remove the glaive, and this game's appeal drops below mediocrity into a rinse-and-repeat nightmare.",
"I would have liked the building and object acquisition to be a little more worthwhile than it is, as that is a big aspect of the original and brings out the interior decorator and architect in all gamers.",
"Between the weak combat, poor visuals, awkward controls and the generally poor gameplay, Cube Life: Island Survival is every bit the awful clone that you might expect to see on iOS or the Xbox 360’s Indie Game library.",
"I would have liked it if there were customizable controls, but it isn't a big deal. For a real innovative pinball experience I would have hoped Nintendo had included a gyroscopic feedback add-on, so I could actually shake the DS to tilt the table. But it's apparent that my dreams may never come true.",
"Technically robust but not that impressive, Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star is a decent representative of the musou genre, with sixteen characters to take care of and a lot of battles to fight. If you truly love the original material, this game could be worthy of your time; otherwise, keep in mind that Berserk and the Band of the Hawk is on its way.",
"An extremely competent brawler, with a shockingly expansive, albeit slightly disjointed, core campaign. Despite its narrative shortcomings, the moment-to-moment combat is fast paced, visually arresting and extremely entertaining. If you are looking for a fun mindless jaunt to kick off the New Year, look no further.",
"Arkanoid Live is good for some occasional casual fun -- as it's always been and always will be -- but with an iffy aesthetic and not much more variety outside of a standard two-player versus mode, it's probably not something you'll want to boot up often.",
"Compared with Final Fantasy XV, released in the same year as World of Final Fantasy, I find this game that much more enjoyable and replayable, because it is a gorgeous throwback to the history of the franchise, and because it doesn't take itself seriously.",
"Mini Motorways is the ultimate blend of city management and arcade mechanics. Much like running a real city, you don't always know what your options will be in a week, but the population continues on. From the minimal art style and controls to the exciting pace of long runs, there is plenty within this seemingly small offering to enjoy. Suddenly identifying a game-ending traffic jam and heading it off before things get bad is satisfying, and there's always fun to be found in beating your own high score.",
"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate doesn't add too much to the original game, which is now one year old. It's a good edition for a very good fighting game, but it comes maybe a little bit late to the party.",
"Yeah, it controls fine and looks <i>fantastic</i>, but it suffers the same ""been there, done that"" feeling as other PS2-to-PSP ports, in this case with the added handicap of no online play. [Jun 2006, p.118]",
"There’s certainly something to be said for such a calming, stress-free adventure – a game that goes out of its way to provide a holiday as much as it does entertainment. [Mar 2006, p.95]",
"It's an accurate and impressive pinball simulator that controls well and has some great 3D visuals. If you have any interest in pinball the way it was originally meant to be played, or are looking to get into the pastime, Zen Pinball 3D should be right up your alley.",
"Redeemer&#146;s gameplay comes across as completely stale, which is a pity because this is most likely the last console game in the World of Darkness (White Wolf is stopping the series next year).",
"It’s average. It’s the sort of by-the-numbers fantastical nonsense you’ve played, completed and discarded a million times before and doesn’t offer anything new besides high resolution graphics and a slight reliance on the ‘A’ button.",
"P4 Dancing All Night is the best possible example about how an IP should be handled when switching genres. It's a rhythm game, but has a deep story like any Persona RPG, and stays faithful to the P4 characters, soundtrack, menu feeling... It's a Persona game, transferred to another genre. And it's very well done. But as a rhythm game has its issues, like a scoring system that it's a little bit unclear and permissive, maybe to avoid frustration in the newcomers. Anyway, if you're a fan of the series and/or the genre, you have a very high chance to fall in love with it.",
"A great pinball game doesn't need 25 different tables and a plethora of unlockable crap. All it needs to do is play well, and no argument can be made that Metroid Prime Pinball's gameplay is lacking.",
Fall of Cybertron didn't manage to surpass Melbourne House's eight year old action-adventure on the PlayStation 2 as my favorite Transformers game. Nonetheless High Moon Studios' interpretation of the conflict between Autobots and Decepticons is definitely worth a look.,
"Over 100 hours of game play through 50 levels of sword-swinging, spell-casting combat, thousands of new weapons and equipment, and two new characters (the fighting furry Vah Shir and the lizardman Iksar) will keep you huffing at trucker speed through the wee hours.",
"Code Mystics has handled this version of Biomotor Unitron with its usual level of quality. All the same features, all of the same flaws, but overall the best official way to play this game. This is a simple, straightforward RPG in most respects, with an interesting customization system to keep you engaged. In modern times it may be too limited and grindy for some, but if you like the idea of slowly cobbling together a killer mech to take the top spot, Biomotor Unitron may be of interest to you.",
"A Space for the Unbound presents a powerful teenage tale combined with everydayness and magic, and manages to surprise with surreal situations strengthen by a fantastic art direction.",
"For all its early indulgence in balls (and the suggestion of which that line of “comedy” might head in), Ballhalla is still at its heart a clever little marble-rolling puzzler with plentiful moments of delightful frustration.",
Underneath the layers of cute pixelated art and a calming lofi-like OST is a short yet memorable story. It will leave you in need of Atma to dive into your heart after it is shattered time and time again by the tales to be told of feeling fearful of one’s future.,
"Thanks to the third-person view, the pace is slowed down considerably from its first-person brethren, which allows for a different gameplay perspective than the typical James Bond title. The upgrade system also really allows the player to make his Bond however he wants him to be.",
"The most far-reaching package of content in the franchise, stretching from the series’ earliest moments all the way to its most recent, but an understanding of its scope requires some history with Kingdom Hearts lore. And because much of it touches on familiar territory, as a whole it lacks an essential feeling that the main numbered entries and spinoffs (like Birth By Sleep) evoke.",
"When everything comes together, Rollerdrome feels incredible, but too often, things get buried under the weight of its many systems. While even at its worst, there is definitely fun to be had here, this feels like an incredible concept for a game where the developers needed to spend a little more time workshopping what aspects of it were really needed. It’s still a good game, though, and the foundation is in place for a sequel to be truly incredible.",
"Collectively, Forza Horizon 5 does everything right, and in doing so makes Playground Games’ latest entry into the Forza franchise an absolute must-play for any racing enthusiast or casual racing fan.",
"Anyone able to overlook the mundane presentation will find an intriguing title that will take time to master its mechanics, and is worth checking out for people who have had their fill of Space Hulk or are after the next digital adaptation of a challenging 90s board game.",
"Madden 25 is the most complete version of the series in more than a decade. Failing to recognize the improvements essentially gives in to reflex hate more than evaluating each version's merits. The gameplay is tighter, customization has seen a significant boost, and each mode has depth. If you buy a version of Madden every five years, it should be this one.",
"Need for Speed Unbound is the franchise’s best entry in a decade, although the competition for that title wasn't particularly stiff. The game offers polished tech, good (if slightly dated) open-world design, and a varied array of events and challenges, but still lags behind the current open-world racer pack leaders. The fantasy of becoming an underground racing champ is also hampered by a restrictive, ill-considered progression system. Nostalgic fans will find plenty to like here, and more general players might want to consider a test drive once the game is marked down, but “need” may be a strong word to attach to Criterion’s latest.",
"Its tactical focus and total absence of resource gathering or base building make the learning curve a little twisty for tank-rush types. However, the authenticity and atmosphere bring the Second World War to life in impressive fashion.",
"If you missed the the PS3 version and Xbox 360, it's time to buy Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Graphically amazing and with a wonderful gameplay, it will satisfy all lovers of the genre.",
A nice addition to the Rainbow Six series as a supplement -- especially if you're a history buff and want to learn more about the real-life men and women combating terrorism around the globe.,
"If you have the patience to overlook its technical shortcomings and master its quirks, Eye of the Beholder is actually a pretty decent dungeon-crawling experience to take on the road with you.",
"After Us poses some well-tread but timely questions about our impact on the world and its living things. However, optional discoveries throughout the game suggest that Piccolo is trying to present a slightly more ambivalent take on the subject. Some of that is best left for the player to discover for themselves. I recommend After Us strongly as a piece of visual artistry. It’s less successful as an interactive experience, but none of its problems are so glaring that it should dissuade someone from discovering its striking and haunting world.",
"A fantastic expansion. It does everything right, fixing some troublesome bugs, adding new units and a new faction, and continuing the story without completely destroying the original good-versus-evil concept that has been the staple of the Lord of the Rings universe.",
"Brave Soldiers might be somewhat a treat to any true fan of Athena and her Saints, however it's a pretty mediocre beat'em up with more flaws than virtues and some of the worst mechanics we have seen in the past few years.",
"I’m torn. On the one hand it’s Age of Empires as I remember it, atmosphere and spirit intact. On the other hand despite refreshed graphics it’s simply an old game so sentiment seems the only driving factor here. [04/2018, p.61]",
"The short missions, limited battle area, and muted visuals may turn some people off, but most will be satisfied with the swift, intuitive gameplay, the online versus, and the simple fact that they are controlling a giant mechanized robot.",
"This franchise used to be a hit, now it’s a depressing miss. Singing through your Phone destroys the karaoke feeling, the soundtrack’s disappointing and the downloading of old songs is way too complicated or impossible. Skip this.",
"The game has a lot of good ideas, but falls a little flat in the execution. Strategy gamers looking for something a little different or those with an interest in the period should give the game a look, but will need to approach it with a bit of patience.",
"Beyond Eyes is an experience like no other. Beautiful and touching... but damn slow. There is virtually nothing to accomplish. Just walking and listening very repetitive sounds, chapter after chapter. Only the gamers that want to live something very unique will embrace this journey. Others will be quickly bored.",
"This game deserved to be full throttle from the very beginning, because of how awesome the tone and art direction is. It is not until you master your skills that Ronin actually becomes rewarding, but when it does you feel like a ninja master.",
"They do have some patchwork to do as far as menu interface and Lobby environment go, but as a friend remarked to me recently, ""we don't buy games for their interface, we buy them for their gameplay"", and gameplay is where Ubisoft's talents have shined brightest.",
"At its core, Once Human is a survival game that encourages and rewards exploration. It nails the gameplay loop of gathering resources and gear, upgrading your character, and then venturing out to do it all over again. I had a great time running around and fighting alongside friends, and I’ll probably continue to jump in and play when I get that survival itch. However, it’s hard not to be put off by forced live-service elements that undercut mechanics and lock unique items behind a paywall.",
"Although there are things about Midnight Club II that certainly aren't new, when you play the game, you feel as if screaming down the boulevard and almost giving yourself a heart attack is suddenly fun again. [May 2003, p.76]",
"The major aspects of Trek to Yomi that will stick with the player are the combat, the atmosphere, and the world design. All three of these key features will drive the player to continue playing and enhance the gameplay. One example would be how exploration can reveal alternate ways to defeat groups of enemies. These moments are few and far between, but their inclusion is a nice reward for players who choose to explore the map. It's one of many smaller pieces of gameplay that makes the overall experience stand out among other indie titles.",
The third Olympic Games with Mario and Sonic is the worst one yet. It offers very few events worth playing and manages to be a party game that doesn’t feel easy to pick up. On top of that you need an entire arsenal of different controllers to even play it.,
"A handful of neat fire and particle special effects can&#146;t hide the fluctuating frame-rate, generic track design and lack of originality that permanently doom Drome Racers to PS2 inconsequentiality.",
"Fallen Legion: Sins of an Empire doesn’t manage to nail all of its ideas, but it manages to make enough of them stick for it to be a worthwhile title for role-playing game fans. Developer YummyYummyTummy didn’t play it safe, and has implemented some fantastic ideas here. It’s just that some repetitive level design, and a flat story, manages to drag the game down in its back half.",
"Evotinction pays homage to traditional stealth games while introducing fresh and intriguing ideas. Though the narrative doesn’t quite reach the heights of its inspirations, it offers some clever twists on the formula. The sound design has a few issues, and the combat feels a bit clunky, but overall, it’s an enjoyable adventure that stays true to its roots.",
"The only thing that Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD really succeeds with is to show how different a portable game is designed and why it usually doesn't work well with the consoles. The missions are boring and bland, and there really isn't anything in this game that isn't twice as good in the regular Assassin's Creed game, making this entry the worst in the series.",
"If you've played Dead Island and want more of the same - Riptide is the game for you. It's smoother, better looking and less buggy, but in the end it's pretty much the same experience all over again, albeit an improved one.",
If the idea of pitting two incredibly strong universes of characters together in an ultimate battle doesn't excite you then the promise of fast paced action gameplay and stunning visuals should draw you in. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is perfectly represented on the Vita and having a portable fighter is always good to have because it is something you can easily drop in and drop out of. With great online and a stellar arcade mode at your fingertips (almost literally) UMVC3 is a game well worth the money for any Vita owner.,
"Thanks to some excellent all-new content and the most polished HD remaster the series has yet seen, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue successfully and beautifully sets the stage for the big showdown of light versus dark in Kingdom Hearts 3. A must-have for fans, and a primo starting point for newcomers.",
"Part Time UFO is a direct and very fun game. It offers simple and great mechanics for both veteran and casual players. Thanks to its great audiovisual personality and especially its physics, you will fall in love with its 30 missions.",
"You know you've found a great puzzler when even the earliest levels in the game leave you feeling completely rewarded. Crush accomplishes this feat thanks to its 40 superbly-designed mazes, fantastic art style, and terrific original concept.",
"Trek to Yomi makes a great first impression. The black and white, combined with the first uses of the combat system, suggests an experience that will allow players to step into the sandals of a samurai. The story might not be extraordinary but there’s enough sentiment in it to keep players engaged. But combat quickly reveals itself to be repetitive, with little need to experiment or to use all the combos. And the presentation does not enhance the gameplay, even if it delivers good screenshots. Trek to Yomi has some good ideas but never uses them to their full potential, which is a shame given its initial promise.",
"A modern yet also deeply conservative reimagining of good old Settlers. There’s a solid base for a good game drowning under some glaring technical issues. Who is this game actually for? Well, maybe for those of you who miss the old titles – and who don’t hold their games to a particularly high standard.",
"Road to Ballhalla is an insanely difficult rhythmic puzzler. It’s enjoyable and agonizing in equal measure, tossing a variety of trials at you then teasing you when you don’t overcome them on the first try. For those who can fight their way through and remain cool-headed, dozens of neat features and hours of playtime await.",
"The problem is that the single-player package stretches the pretty basic gameplay worryingly thin, and leaderboard competition can only keep you interested for so long. If you're looking for a decent arcade romp you could do a lot worse than pick up Zombie Driver HD. It's just that you could do a lot better, too.",
"Atari Flashback Classics is a decent release. Despite some small issues, it is a great way to experience the early days of video gaming. Some games may not appeal to you, while others will bring back great memories. I would have liked better emulation in some areas, and more licensed games but what we get for the price isn’t too bad at all. If you’re a fan of classic Atari, or just want to see where gaming basically began, they you should definitely check this collection out. It’s certainly not the best it could have been, but definitely not the worst classic game collection available. As a huge Atari fan, I would say it’s worth your time.",
"It's the little things that add up, one by one, to an often hypnotically bland, slapdash campaign. The core is sound enough, but Burning Skies is far too shabby in places for what is supposed to be the flagship first-party shooter on the Vita - indeed, the flagship shooter on handhelds, full stop.",
"Grip: Combat Racing not only brings back the exciting racing gameplay of the highly underrated Rollcage series, it manages to make it even more enjoyable. Factor in online play and you're left with one of the best arcade-style racing games ever made.",
"Onimusha is still pleasant and fluid to play, showing off those beautiful precalculated backgrounds that we once loved. However, the remastared version suffers from its lack of new content, and doesn't fix some of the problems we faced many years ago.",
"By no stretch of imagination is Hellboy: The Science of Evil a good example of the third-person action genre, the bland level designs, uninspired combat and an overall dated feel contribute to yet another poor comic-book adaptation. Nevertheless, Krome have captured Hellboy's character well and perhaps the game's limited scope will find some appeal to a younger audience - it worked for Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk.",
"It's certainly good to look at, the visual gags work well enough, and most of the brainteasers are intuitive. Yet, in a genre that advances as quickly as the pyramids, the few knobs and whistles that modern technology brings really don't drag Ankh up to the level of its glorious forebears, and the linguistic difficulties and its brevity knock it down.",
"Fall of Cybertron's multiplayer component also benefits from High Moon's sincere approach to the source material, always enabling those giddy moments in which you and your teammates leap into the air, transform and blast off to the next objective.",
"Not a single element in this game stands out as remarkable or even remotely average. Flight Combat fans have a choice, they can download War Thunder for free and enjoy it, or they can buy Vector Thrust and despise it. Easiest. Decision. Ever.",
"The first Darksiders rightly garnered itself a cult following, but it's barely fit to hold a candle to Darksiders II. Bigger, bolder, more creative, more interesting, deeper, smarter, better... Hurl all the positive adjectives and adverbs you want at this action-adventure sequel and they'll stick good and tight. [Oct 2012, p.73]",
"This is not Ridge Racer as we know it; it is a complete re-imagining of the series. For the better or worse Ridge Racer has changed, it is no longer a circuit racer but it still features similar drift centric handling.",
"If you like hiking through the mountains for hours, a high-powered rifle cradled in your arms, then watching your screen go crimson as a sniper arcs three rounds into your head from like four klicks away, then this is truly the ideal game for you.",
"South of Midnight establishes itself as a good platform adventure that is enhanced by a deeper than expected narrative and an absolutely captivating artwork. While the combat falls a bit short, we are faced with one of the Xbox games with the most personality of the generation.",
"""Wrestlemania X8"" was hardly a perfect game but at least it was good. WWE Survivor Series sees it, but doesn't raise (that's poker lingo for your information). It resides in the shell of its predecessor.",
If you've never played either of the two previous Cities XL titles this is a much better value proposition and more worth your time – as long as you understand this is a solid – but flawed – title.,
"Boyfriend Dungeon is worth the detour for its very catchy concept alone. After all, what other game will have you dating half-man, half-weapon people that you can wield in dungeons? The first hours of the Kitfox Games title are very eye-catching. But the studio struggles to keep the fun going. This is due to the dates that drag on and the phases of action that generally lack diversity, both for the ""dunjs"" and for the weapons on offer. However, it is hard to imagine not recommending Boyfriend Dungeon if you are looking for a refreshing title. A nice surprise.",
"The story and puzzles are decent in Aporia: Beyond The Valley, so it's a shame that the world is roughly designed, there are consistency and technical issues, and the horror element is shallow.",
"All in all, Trek to Yomi is a pretty solid game if a little short. I won’t fault a game for being single-digit hours long, as long as it delivers a good story; Trek to Yomi certainly did. As mentioned prior, the additional story path options potentially take the game up to a good probably 10 hours, assuming all are approximately the same. The challenge offered by completing the game on higher difficulties can also invite a challenge to squeeze a few more hours out, and the combat is fun enough to welcome a playthrough just for difficulties sake.",
"Of all of the HD remastered packs of the Kingdom Hearts franchise, 2.8 is probably the one with the least gameplay hours, but the one that fans will want to have the most, because of the innovative Birt By Sleep 0.2. This A Fragmentary Passage is 3 hours long and is more a visual and gameplay prelude of what we'll have in KH3.",
A decent enough game that won't leave much of a lasting impression. It's good if you just want some mindless fun but don't go in expecting anything more because the only payback you'll get is a shot in the foot.,
"If you only played the Xbox version of Mafia, you'd still get a sense of the game's ambitious nature, and you'd enjoy some of its finer points, but you'd also miss out on the PC version's outstandingly good graphics and its more seamless gameplay experience.",
"A Fisherman’s Tale tells a charming story with surprising depth that is unfortunately marred by technical issues. Within its brief playtime, the game’s story packs in enough thought provoking content that I found myself thinking about it for days after playing. Though I’m not recommending A Fisherman’s Tale, I wouldn’t blame you if you decided to play it anyhow.",
"A simple but ultimately enjoyable brawler, Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers is a good attempt at turning an anime license into a solid video game. Fans should enjoy the title's retelling of the source material, while newcomers will find the combat system refreshingly accessible.",
"Kick & Fennick has a slow start, but the last hours of this adventure are certainly worth your time. This side-scroller offers an awesome puzzle world with challenge and action, but we do feel that this game could have been much more. A deeper story and less repetitiveness perhaps?",
"The First Berserker delivers an uncompromisingly tight combat experience that is further buoyed by an interesting, if somewhat unevenly paced, plot and a gorgeous presentation that is equal parts relentlessly grim and oppressive. The bosses are epic, enthralling, and even elegant at times, and even in easy mode, players are sure to get a tough but fair adventure. Its commitment to this identity is both impressive and formidable, and The First Berserker is sure to deliver thrills to players willing to meet its challenges.",
"Five years after the fifth chapter, the Might & Magic saga is renewed with enhanced graphics, tecnichal improvements, and a leading online support. Recommended to all strategy games addicts, the fans of the M&M Heroes saga or fantasy lovers looking for a new experience.",
"As engrossing and deep as Gallop Racer 2006 is, it's still a horse-racing simulation, after all. This severely limits the appeal of the game, as most people are probably more interested in managing a football franchise or a baseball team than a horse farm.",
"The game does a great job of letting players logically put together clues. It hides them well at the center of the Roottree's web, but the farther out it goes, it may grate over time. The writing is worth absorbing as players go along and this feels like a real family that could have existed. While this story is certainly told in a way that makes it one of the more unique mystery games out there, it's the method in which players are asked to discover it that holds it back.",
"THQ and Vigil Games have taken the Darksiders franchise and released a sequel to the original that is such an incredible game it exceeds every expectation I had. From the production values to the size and scope of the game itself, you can't help but sit back and be amazed with what they have done here.",
"Sadly, even loading an MP3 of ‘90s favorite “Mr. Jones” by Counting Crows didn’t make any of these four music mini-games and passive experiences any less boring or more bearable. If my friends came over to check out my new $400 VR headset, Harmonix Music VR is the last thing I’d want to show them.",
"Squeenix once again delivers a grand adventure, with the main quest being at least 60 hours. In a genre which many think has become redundant and stale, FFXII stands out with a unique battle system, endearing characters, and a beautifully crafted, well presented story.",
"I would recommend NBA 2K23 for its sheer breadth of material and the fact that it really tries to be a basketball universe unto itself (hence the massive file size). It's certainly not perfect, as I still keep running into odd glitches now and then, and even some strange things that carry over from the last game (Do I really have to keep walking through the Dallas Mavericks shootaround to get to my guys? Why is that still a thing?), but it is and shall likely always be the sports game I play almost every day, no matter what time of year it actually is — even when the fans tell me I stink.",
"Sumo Digital managed to offer simple but well implemented gameplay. Some of the stages and mini-games are fun, even if it’s only for the nostalgic ride. But they don’t make up for the fact that we miss some more tennis matches. Anyway, if you ever dreamt of seeing the dwarf from Golden Axe in the same stage as Ulala and Amigo…you might as well give it a try. [Apr 2008]",
"Ikachan is disturbingly short, but the winning game design and charm might make the $4.99 download worth your time, especially if you’re a fan of Cave Story or Nicalis’ other work.",
"The newest installment of Bohemia's military-game is a product with great potential, especially from the community’s side. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. It's a game that lives through the community.",
"Concord doesn't stand out much compared to the other free multiplayer games on the market, so you're not really missing out on much. It's sad to say, but with this poor performance, Sony will eventually give in and make it a free game; That's the only way I would recommend it.",
"While the gameplay relies on being grindy and some of the narrative elements fall short, Rollerdrome still offers a highly enjoyable experience, especially for fans of action games.",
"Dead Cells is absolutely amazing. This game is to action games what Celeste was for platforming games when it was released earlier this year. Dead Cells has it all: great and speedy combat, fantastic progression system (you'll see), and amazing music that you will come back to listen to.",
The jerky framerate in particular is unforgivable and not tweaking the game engine to account for the extra grunt behind the GameCube is something that Midway should acknowledge as a huge mistake.,
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a pretty fun remaster. Its scenarios are very varied, and its gameplay keeps you entertained. Unfortunately, the fun ends very soon, and there are few replay values.",
"It isn't the prettiest thing out there, and there are a few rough edges here and there when it comes to bombing and the like, but otherwise, it's a decent simulation that'll have you cheering as you attack Japanese and German bases.",
"The greatest strength of Life is Strange is that the excellent character work, supernatural twists, and serene environments manage to overcome any technical issues. It was easy for us to get hooked on guiding Max through this tumultuous time in her life, and the ending left our hearts and minds drained.",
"Like most MMORPGs, the fate of Throne and Liberty will rely heavily on the decisions NCSoft and Amazon Games make in regard to future content. Nothing beats a solid MMORPG launch; and so far, at least the Early Access launch has been incredibly smooth. But the ability to keep meaningful and fun content coming is what keeps players logging in and overall making the MMO feel worth playing. In its current state, you’ll be hard-pressed to find an F2P MMORPG with as much content and polish as Throne and Liberty. If you’ve been looking for something that puts the MMO back into MMORPG, this could be just what you’re looking for.",
"Minis on the Move is filled with plenty of content to keep you busy for a long time. The puzzles quickly get more challenging, keeping you from dozing off. All in all a great puzzle game for on the road.",
"The most stunning combat flight simulator I have ever seen. It's nerve racking, historically educational, deeply immersive, graphically unbelievable, awe-inspiring and a sim that proves once again an old axiom -- it's intense software that drives the development of intense hardware.",
"At a couple of quid less we’d suggest that most people think about giving it a punt (or, indeed, a jab?) but for now this will probably remain in the quite small ‘passionate about boxing, owns a Vita’ niche.",
"There are a number of technical issues which blight Forgotten Fields but there’s nothing here that couldn’t be addressed over time and with patches. The core of the game, featuring a very human and relatable story mirrored in a literary fantasy one, shines bright enough that those who can forgive a few glitches will find something unique and interesting here.",
"It isn’t perfect, but I can’t think of another Wii U game that I’d recommend more than Lego City Undercover. It’s the most interesting and highly polished game in TT Games’ large repertoire, and it fills an important game gap. Now kids (and their parents) can tool around in a big town where people smile even as you almost run them over in an ice-cream truck.",
"As for controls, combat and inventory-sorting are quick and clean. Spellcasting can be frustrating, though, as aiming projectiles is often a trial-by-error process. [March 2005, p.90]",
"Once again, Visual Concepts shows that they deserve all the credit, with solid gameplay and an absolutely huge amount of content. Special mention to Eras, a new addition that sets an inflection point in sports videogames.",
"You'll see a lot of poor passes (regardless of your quarterback choice), poor tackling (even for a computer-controlled player), hot and cold A.I. and many, many wide open receivers dropping balls. This is probably the most frustrating aspect of NCAA 2k3.",
Manages to accomplish more then you would expect with such a simple gameplay structure and limited environment. It doesn&#146;t break any new ground but fans of adventure games will find enough motivation to capture all 999 ghosts.,
"This is the kind of experience where gamers will often know how to get to the base but will struggle mightily to remake the environment or defeat enemies while keeping all the darsanauts in line and alive. Moons Of Darsalon is clearly a labor of love and I like much of what it’s trying to do, even if I think the effort should have been spent on another core gameplay loop.",
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac brings a classic back to life and then some. While the locked camera and tricky angles might frustrate some, it is still a fun game that expands the Pac-Man universe and reminds us that this old power pellet eater still has a lot of life left in him.",
With a myriad of multiplayer game types and the simple fact that this game is more fun to play with other humans makes this a great pickup if you have Xbox Live. If you don't have Live you probably want to steer clear of this game.,
"The retro touches like the return of cheesy cut-scenes, the universe itself and the focus on Tiberium in its decidedly science fiction storyline have had just the right amount of effort applied to make this an incredibly refined experience.",
"Gears 2 is a lesson in masterful pacing; whether it’s lulling you into a false sense of security, dropping you into an inescapable situation, or blowing your hair back with a ‘speeder bike’ vehicle section. It’s a ripping good yarn that is continually one-upping itself by belting you upside the head with yet another over the top action sequence that eclipses the last awesome thing you just did.",
"Taking all aspects into consideration, I would highly recommend Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos. Despite its lack of engaging plot and characters, the gameplay is outstanding and makes the experience worth it on its own. I did not find myself wishing for a better plot and characters 99% of the time, because I was so caught up in trying to figure out how to make it through or find the next dungeon. Even better, the game can be multiplier, so it has the perfect setup to have a blast trying to get through the dungeons with family or friends.",
"Ultimately, this is what you need to know: for ten bucks, you can buy the videogame equivalent of a bag of Cheetos and a porno mag, except the Cheetos are zombies and the naked people are driving cars with flamethrowers attached to them.",
"FIFA Street 2 just isn't much fun to play, plain and simple. It won't gain many supporters from the soccer enthusiast set, nor arcade sports fans. The multiplayer isn't even that great - shunning online completely.",
"How do you handle the reworking of one of the greatest classical works in history? With great patience, skill and respect. With video games, it's no different than with other art forms. 'Final Fantasy VII' was not just restored, but completely remade. 'Rebirth' is not a sacrilege, but the finest tribute this classic could ever receive.",
"The only good aspect about Kick & Fennick is its gameplay and the recoil mechanic. The two characters are anonymous, they don't really cooperate each other and the game has no story.",
"The issues with This is the Police 2 mostly boil down to pacing. The cutscenes are so long that you can forget that you're playing a game at all, and they serve to space out the moments of gameplay a bit too far, creating a disjointed feeling between the other aspects of the game. Trimming down the dialogue and letting players have more interaction in each cutscene could have gone a long way toward tightening up the pacing while keeping the world and character building just as strong.",
"Weaving a grand narrative clearly wasn't the developer's goal, but crafting a fun, pleasing, and hugely explorable world was. And in that regard, Splashteam nailed it. Minor complaints aside, Tinykin is a bright and accessible game with some slick mechanics that allow the player to focus on what they came for: getting a tiny spaceman lost in a big, beautiful world.",
"What is great about the game and the story line especially is that there are awesome villains and none of them seem like a throw away add on to the game. The levels leading up to boss battles are well designed, giving Spider-Man the chance to use his unique abilities. Story line writer Dan Slott really brings a story that is perhaps one of the best in any Spider-Man game yet.",
"I enjoyed this game up until the halfway point. Then, the sheer lack of any really new gameplay mechanics and the amazing repetitiveness of collecting really got to me. [July 2002, p.40]",
"It loads frequently, the graphics are bland and first-generation, and the music smacks of elevator-itis. Plus, the game&#146;s looping structure is cooler in theory than in reality.",
"It's a shame that the controls weren't tighter and the level design weren't more varied, because this one could have been a classic. As it stands now, it's a title easily worth picking up for shooter fans tired of being stuck with R-Type.",
"While I wanted a few more quality of life improvements and would've liked more visual improvements or consistency, what Monolith Soft have put out in Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is nothing short of spectacular.",
"A game that has a great little concept, a wonky campaign, AI bots that aren't quite up to the challenge of challenging you and somewhat dodgy netcode. It's incredibly frustrating, because the core concept works, and it works well. It's just all the rest that's falling apart at the seams.",
"Altogether, Dicefolk is a successful amalgamation of multiple concepts layered on top of each other in a satisfying way. The only real issue this reviewer could really bring to the table is the game loop feels a bit more repetitive than it does satisfying, but that could just be this particular reviewer's thoughts on roguelikes and as such may not be a reliable view on the loop. Along with this the story and music feel a bit lacking in scale, but again this was likely more of an expectation of an RPG type game rather than a roguelike one. But with that being said If gamers are fans of any of the concepts that Dicefolk is made up of, from deck building to roguelikes to creature collecting, it is certainly worth a look, if not an outright pickup!",
"Samurai Warriors 4 Empires adds a significant strategic dose to the usual battles in the franchise. The game interface is simple and accessible, and can be enjoyed by all types of users. A pretty good game, full of content.",
"A fantastic RPG. It blows all of its PS2 competition this year right out of the water and is among the all time elite role-players ever made for the system. ""Kingdom Hearts,"" ""Devil Summoner,"" ""Xenosaga III,"" ""Tales of the Abyss""... none of them are on the same level as Square Enix's bold and riveting move in a new direction.",
"The outright fun this game brings should result in a higher score, but the gameplay snafus on Billy's missions really weight it down. I still highly recommend this game to FPS and Old West fans, though.",
"Overall, Mahjong Cub3d is a solid title if you enjoy puzzles and have a fondness for Mahjong Solitaire. At $30, it's a budget title for the 3DS, but it's still a considerable amount of cash. Still, the title packs a solid amount of play time, and it's a refreshing take on a classic game. If you're a puzzle fan looking for a title on the 3DS, Mahjong Cub3d is a good choice.",
"Bit.Trip Void is a stylish homage to the graphic and the spirit of the iconic videogames of the 80s. It is also a brilliant puzzle game with an intuitive and addictive mechanic. The only flaws are its shortness and the lack of online leaderboards, but for 600 points it's a good choice.",
"Revita is not one to overlook, especially for fans of this genre. Things feel perfectly balanced, the combat is satisfying and the platforming is smooth, the relics do a lot to keep each run fresh, and using health as currency all come together to make Revita sing.",
"Those hoping for 90° Kirby won’t get it in BoxBoy, but those looking for BoxBoy—puzzle-solving, muted box-making extraordinaire—need not look any further. Kirby is not up to this task. Unless, of course, Kirby eats BoxBoy and acquires his powers. Then Kirby might do just fine.",
"Definitely a throwback to the arcade days, being almost identical to the arcade original. The new gameplay aspects add a little spice to the formula, but don’t add a whole lot of content overall.",
"Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move provides a ton of variety and a consistent level of challenge. It's a simple, accessible and entertaining puzzle game that combines Nintendo craftsmanship with a competitive price tag.",
"Oil Rush is a solid, nice looking RTS, with a good number of missions and a decent variety of maps. It's fun and enjoyable, especially for the fans of the genre, but it also suffers from a couple of annoying problems.",
"For all of the things that it does well, Forge feels like it needs more time in development and beta to achieve its potential. I really like the game's model of instanced PvP, and enjoy Forge's dynamic third-person combat. The overall features feel unfinished, however, and while it looks like Dark Vale Games is aware of Forge's missing - and necessary - elements and is working to include them, the game in its released state requires a bit of faith in the developers to make it what it should be. The core gameplay experience is fun and frantic, but Forge will need to attend to a more robust feature set to encourage the dedicated community it requires to succeed.",
"Sure it’s packed with drool-worthy game modes, interesting new features and a slick presentation but it’s plagued by flaws too hard to ignore and visuals just not good enough to make this a game worth buying.",
"The additions and fixes to War of the Ring mode make that style of play a much more inviting option this time around. There are still some AI issues on the strategic map and using navies needs to be an option, but overall, War of the Ring should bring plenty of hours of entertainment.",
"Namco Museum is a fantastic self-contained package with an interesting offering of games that arcade fans will enjoy tearing into. It's found a suitable home on the Nintendo Switch. While it isn't rife with the ""virtual museum"" content previous games in the series back on the original PlayStation offered, it is a solid and feature-rich compilation title that's worth its asking price.",
"If you're still rocking a DS Lite and own all four GBA games already, then you might not need this collection, but if you missed even one of the Zero games in the past, you're sure to get your $30 worth.",
"There’s nog big changes in TESO Elsweyr, but it does has a nice little walk in the Khajiits’ homeland. The writing is neat and the characters are great, which will fullfil the lore addicts.",
"Behind a pink mist, Criminal Girls - Invite Only hides a dull dungeon crawler, with a boring gameplay and luck based mechanics. If punishing half naked girls with your fingers is not your bread and butter, you can avoid this game entirely.",
"Darksiders II is an absolutely outstanding experience, the combat is fluid, the story is well written, the RPG elements add a lot of depth and the side quests will add many extra hours to your time with the game. As we enter the twilight of the 360's life, this really is a stand out game of the highest quality.",
"Boyfriend Dungeon is satisfying and very good at making you care about its weapon-people (and cat). The gameplay loop is among the most addictive I’ve seen, especially since it is constantly rewarding you with more scenes with its characters and opportunities to get stronger. Which does put a damper on the elements that aren’t quite perfect. Jesse and Olivia could have been handled better as NPCs, only having two dungeons right away makes it feels like things end too quickly, and I hated having to be the bigger person and keep dealing with an antagonist. That said, when the heavily teased additional characters and dungeon come out, I absolutely can’t wait to return to Verona Beach.",
"While it may not be a masterclass of the genre, The First Berserker: Khazan is a thrill that improves the more you play. It has unique mechanics that differentiate it from other soulslikes, while never losing sight of what it sets out to be. While the story may not be the most entrancing, there's certainly enough there to compel players to get to the end, no matter how many controllers or keyboards lost their lives in the process.",
"The Forbidden Arts will remind you of those old 99p bargain bin games with a drab colour palette, annoying music and half-baked combat. Some platforming elements are enjoyable, but the overall package is a chore rather than a joy to play.",
"NBA 2K23 has everything needed in order to make NBA's fans fall in love, but it still has more than an aspect that needs improvement, from the AI to the intrusive microtransactions.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth expands the 2020 game by taking this second installment to new playable horizons and the individual stories of each character are more developed. The open world makes a difference from the usual as it is full of activities to do and secrets. The rule that says ""don't touch anything that isn't broken"" was implemented and they also added new playable options that notably improve the experience.",
"Madden NFL 10 may not have taken huge leaps and bounds forward, but the game does build on last years solid instalment. Tweaks in a few key areas, most notably the games AI mean the game provides a more realistic and fluid experience of the NFL.",
"Immortal: Unchained isn’t inherently an awful game, but it has very little going in its favour. Its level design is one shining beacon among a sea of bang average gameplay, unacceptable technical flaws, and a combat system that does little to distinguish itself from its inspirations. Those enamoured with the Souls formula may discover something to like, but they’ll have to sort through a mountain of mediocrity to find it.",
"There are many more original real-time strategies out there, but few that scream ""pick up and play me"" as loudly as Tiberium Wars. Its back to the basics approach to the genre won’t win any prizes for innovation, but it should prove to be a fan favorite anyway.",
"An homage to the old coated in a shine that stands it proud alongside the new. We'd welcome a sequel to tighten up the odd area, but if this ends up being Sakaguchi's last story, he can ride into the sunset in considerable glory.",
"Enjoying Mario in the genre that saw him born is always a great pleasure, even if you are not a fan of the platform titles. Nintendo returns to its specialty: to offer hours and hours of fun by giving us games with their own personality and a shellproof gameplay.",
"Kill Team from the outset looked like nothing more than a PR stunt to help boost the sales of Space Marines, it's just worrying to think that all the time and effort that went into making Kill Team would have found better use improving the big brother Space Marine game.",
"Supreme Ruler: Cold War is an old strategy game whose gameplay recalls the times when you had to face real difficulties and every videogame was a challenge. Same goes for the technical side, with its graphics and sound that seem to come back from the '90s. Only for fans.",
"A successor mostly in name and less in essence that suffers from limited scope. It tries to attract veterans and newcomers alike, ultimately failing to provide challenge and depth to the former and something innovative and on par with the competition to the latter.",
"Far from the appeal of a Fallout 3, Metro Last Light bets on a really dark and nerve racking post-apocalyptic ambiance. This undoubtedly is the strong point of the game, but not the only one. The latest 4A's Games subtly mixes gunfights, stealth approach and storyline that confirm the literary roots of the script. Offering good immersion despite some minor problems with the AI, the game leads the player in a very intricate world. A world where the beauty of the graphics allows to forget about the drawbacks mentioned, especially on PC with potent graphics cards where the game can be put through its paces. If the fans of Metro 2033 will swear at the distribution method of the ""Ranger"" mode, they can be reassured, Metro Last Light is as good as it's prequel, and maybe even better.",
"Apart from a few, more or less insignificant, flaws this game shines or rather consumes all light and delivers an epic story and an experience that hasn't been seen yet on the GameCube and one that hasn't ever quite been realised on any other console.",
"Even though some aspects of Guardian Heroes haven't aged well, the strength of the battle system, branching paths, and characters help this brawler retain its place near the top of the class.",
"Dicefolk has truly amazing combat that makes great use of its rotation and dice mechanics, and it's bolstered by a ton of impressive designs in tthe Chimeras, each packing their own skills that are fun to experiment with as you craft your dream team and playstyle. Unfortunately, the lack of any interesting story hinders the experience and can easily leave you wanting more. Still, as long as you desire a unique spin on the traditional creature-collecting formula and the battles associated with it, Dicefolk can still be worth checking out, even if the odds of you enjoying the game for longer periods may boil down to a dice roll.",
"Foretales easily fits as al so-much-potential game to me. The skeleton’s there: I love the branching paths, the core game design and how the cards are used, the presentation, and how well-hidden secrets appear to be, but there’s not enough flesh on those bones. Whether trying to create a tight, controlled experience that doesn’t get away from them or just not having enough resources to add a huge variety of cards, Foretales suffers. This title has the trappings of a phenomenal, top-tier experience but is just far too repetitive and slow.",
"With The Urbz, EA has trimmed down the general Sims formula, removing more in-depth options along the way, but, in doing so, they've also cut away the very captivating essence of the franchise.",
"Though I did eventually grow bored of its puzzles, I never tired of Samorost 3's world. Added mechanical depth and variety would have certainly made the game richer, but every subtle visual detail, every lingering musical note, every delightful interaction coalesces into a truly special world that makes Samorost 3 worthwhile nonetheless.",
"Although the first wave of the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass was a bit underwhelming, the release of the second wave, Side Order, makes the DLC an absolute must-have for Splatoon fans and those who are fond of the roguelite genre. The Splatoon IP has always primarily focused on online multiplayer, but Side Order further proves that its single-player offerings shouldn’t be overlooked either. If you already own Splatoon 3, getting the Expansion Pass is a no-brainer for the price, but if you don’t, now is a better time than ever to join in on the splatastic fun. Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass is available now via the Nintendo eShop.",
"With nothing in common with the original, Yars' Revenge is a terrible bad incarnation of the original classic. Hopefully Atari will learn from this mistake and do something better the next time they decide to to a HD remake of one of their classics.",
"While not quite worthy of a Michelin star, fans of the film and kids looking for fun will be thrilled. It might not offer the biggest of helpings but, while it lasts, Ratatouille tastes great.",
"If you just want something to jump in and out of without any commitment required, Urban Trial Playground will more or less do the trick. If you want anything more than that, you’ll probably have to wait until Trials Rising in February, but until then, this will act as an okay stopgap.",
This game appears to be suited for the younger audience but not too young as some of the evil characters are freaky with their weird screams and looks they may scare the little ones.,
"Sonic Rivals still stands head and shoulders over other recent efforts in the franchise - and, indeed, over many other recent PSP titles - simply because the game at the heart of it all is downright fun.",
"If you had to describe Splatoon 2 in a single word, it would simply be ""fun"". Pure, unadulterated fun that will last you a significant amount of time. With competent single player mode, addictive multiplayer modes and the promise of regular content it's another top quality - and essential - Switch release. Just make the Salmon Run more frequent, Nintendo.",
"There's a healthy number of items to unlock, characters to level and modes to play will keep you coming back for more. It's a pity then that it's burdened by some painful attempts to demand players throw in some extra cash for the DLC.",
"Even if no one in your family gets into the Toy-Con Garage, the Nintendo Labo Toy-Con Variety Kit should still provide plenty of fun. My family was amazed while making these ingenious, multifaceted models and delighted as we watched them come to life with a little digital magic.",
"Cities XL 2012 is a solid city builder, but unfortunately, nothing more. Play depth isn't as big as one might expect, the graphics are more resource hungry than truly good, the trade system makes you hope for online multiplayer in vain. That, and it's really just an add-on to Cities XL 2011.",
"It's easy to praise American Nightmare for what it is, but it's also hard to ignore what it's not: the proper Alan Wake sequel we're clamouring for. It's a game constrained by form, obviously meant as a stopgap in which Remedy can test out a few new ideas without having to craft an entire new game around them.",
"Loop Hero is a highly addicting roguelite gaming, that strikes with its originality and complex game system. Game after game, loop after loop the mere concept of time will vanish, and it will leave you craving for more.",
"While the quality of every game is ultimately subjective, Once Human is unique in how, other than its serious technical issues, all of its problems or strengths are contentious ones that it is easy to imagine every person feeling differently about. For many, however, I suspect that it will end up being such a mixed bag as not to be worth sticking with in favor of a more focused and refined competitor.",
"It’s the margin of potential character advancement, simple yet strategic combat, endearing story and intriguing character interaction that makes a strategy RPG for me. La Pucelle has all that and more.",
"The environments are detailed and beautiful, replete with pops of colour. Unfortunately, navigating them through a haze of lag destroys your enjoyment quite quickly. Pathways are dotted with doors, and the slightest glance in their direction pops you into places that you don’t want to be.",
"Oil Rush manages to separate itself from the flock through a range of novel ideas and features, while still remaining accessible to all fans of the genre. It has a few flaws, but is still well worth getting.",
"A slick and fun puzzle experience from start to finish, BOXBOY! will please anyone looking for a great new pick-up-and-play adventure. Just don't expect too much challenge until you dive into the optional areas of the game.",
"It becomes readily apparent that those who will enjoy Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time the most will be existing fans of the series. The storyline and new animations are worth checking out, especially since the second season is still a ways out. Even then, they may be hard-pressed to deal with both the tedious exploration and the unreliable combat. For them, the game may be worth getting for cheap. For everyone else, this should be a pass.",
"It is still a nice paced game that will take you a while to beat and require a fair bit of time for the not-so-talented gamer, but graphics have seemed to have dropped to a level that the PS2 can handle, and the camera angles are shocking along with the aiming system.",
"Concord is a hero shooter with effective graphics and really fun gunplay, features that fail to stand out due to the presence of significant issues, both in terms of roster balance and the characterization of individual fighters. The functioning of the round mode needs to be reviewed and the progression system seemed to us to lack bite, due to rewards that are not worthy of attention. In short, the situation of the title by Firewalk Studios is not rosy at all at the moment.",
"At the end, A Space for the Unbound is one of the best indies of the year so far. The gaming experience is pleasant, but also emotional and capable of generating some unpleasant emotions. Definitely, it's an indie game worth giving a chance, even though its story and ending may break our hearts, and the Space Dive reminds us to take care of our mind and emotions.",
"It's quite unlikely that the intended audience for Super Princess Peach ever played ""Super Mario Bros"" back in the day, or perhaps any of the many sequels - and therefore is almost likely to be a newcomer to the platform genre. And if that's the case, Peach is a perfect primer, just in time for ""New Super Mario Bros"" in a few months time.",
"Having the freedom to tackle challenges in a less linear fashion is definitely a strength, but the open-ended play that comes with traversing a massive city is more of a curse than anything. [Nov 2003, p.136]",
"If you're looking for a replayable sci-fi strategy game to grab a hold of your man hours, then Endless Space 2 will provide you with all you desire. Endless Space 2 sets a new and beautiful benchmark for the 4X genre, masterfully laid out and something future 4x developers will enjoy learning from.",
"Sure, it's easy to pick up and play, the graphics and sound are just about passable and there's a decent range of weapons, but if I had gone out and bought it I'd feel somewhat cheated as I played the first mission, only to find that there's very little new here.",
"Its addictive gameplay will make sure that you play through all 80 missions, and come back for more. Furthermore, it features a solid amount of depth, and its presentation is quite easy on the eyes.",
"Pikuniku is a strange little game. It’s unique, hilarious, and extremely fun, but it shines most when it’s played with a friend. It’s a little on the short side, and some of the campaign’s level design is basic at best, but there’s no shortage of charm on display, and it’s hard not to walk away with a smile on your face.",
"While it may not offer the intricate detailing of some other clean-up simulators, Spilled compensates with its heart-warming charm and accessible gameplay plus endearing graphics that is complemented by its subtle soundtrack. It’s a testament to the creativity and passion of indie developers, and a must-try for anyone seeking a relaxing yet meaningful gaming experience.",
"If you are nostalgic for the gaming scene of the 90s, The Big Con is a can’t-miss throwback. But even if you are maybe a little younger, or sick of wallowing in that most radical of eras, you may find a lot to like. It’s certainly a very cool con artist story, which is appealing to me. Funny and a little melancholy, The Big Con is exactly the sort of adventure game I’ve been wanting to play for decades.",
"Ultimately not a bad game, just ""too casual"". Definitely enjoyable for many, especially younger players, gamers with lives or those who actually prefer the simplicity. For a hardcore reviewer like me, the gameplay is unfortunately just too simple, repetitive and unchallenging.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a bumper remaster package that has clearly been made with love by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. It contains all of the best levels from the series’ most beloved entries, a fleshed-out ranking system for the most ambitious players and a dozen party games to extend its lifespan. With cute crossover characters, rewarding puzzles and an absolutely banging soundtrack, you’d be foolish to skip this one if you’re yet to engage with the Super Monkey Ball franchise.",
"While it’s still somewhat struggling with the legacy of Bullfrog’s Dungeon Keeper, Dungeons 4 from German developer Realmforge Studios continues to carve out its own identity. A very solid and refined gameplay loop is somewhat held back by quickly dated humor and some visual clutter. If you liked the earlier Dungeons games, expect more of the same with smaller additions and improvements, but those itching to be evil don’t have a better alternative anyway.",
"As a lifelong Mario fanatic, I could talk endlessly about all of the game's little details, but all you really need to know is that the classic Mario formula is back and is as fun as ever. [Holiday 2009, p.78]",
"Knights and Bikes is a fun, frantic, top-down adventure game with some light puzzle and combat elements that I imagine would be more appreciated by either a younger crowd or a parent playing with their kid. If you’re looking for a solid co-op adventure, this can easily fill the void. Even solo it’s still fun enough to be worth a look. Just be ready for a few awkward moments, and a seriously terrible UI.",
"Yonder has some interesting aspects to it, and while they really tried to throw in everything and the kitchen sink into it minus combat, many of them fall flat or shallow. The exploration is the best part of the game by far, and while the other parts of the game may be to shallow for me, others may find enjoyment out of them. Even then, the pacing is well done and players will have a pretty view the entire time. I’d say wait for price drop, but when that happens check it out.",
"A playable RTS and even marginally entertaining, but that’s only because its developers blatantly adopted every single hackneyed RTS convention they could get their hands on. Even the fall guy has enough self-respect to avoid doing that.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 isn't quite on par with the best Final Fantasy adventures, but it's a competent, enjoyable adventure from start to finish-something the series has been lacking in recent years.",
"Rollerdrome is undeniably one of the must-watch indie games of the summer for its great feel, satisfying punching shots, and vibrant 80s soundtrack. And if the beauty of the tricks is secondary, their usefulness during a hyper-paced performance constitutes a clever balance and very well balanced in terms of gameplay.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it is a soul-like experience worth the time of any fan of the genre. It features frantic combat, stunning aesthetic and visual design, and a challenging yet satisfying difficulty that will fill you with excitement as you embark on this journey of vengeance.",
"I really can't stress how much fun NPPL Championship Paintball 2009 can be, provided you take it upon yourself to make it fun. Unfortunately, there's not much to keep the player engaged for the long run -- a fact exacerbated by the awkward animation, minor technical snafus, and the mid-nineties, Gen-X rut the soundtrack fell into.",
"With Darksiders II, the franchise has cemented itself as an essential property among the likes of Devil May Cry and God of War. Even with the scale increasing in practically every area, the game manages to be less intimidating than its predecessor.",
"I really liked playing Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension because every level seemed to have something different to do, and failing that, at least it always looked radically different from level to level.",
"With its charming characters and engaging story, Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time could have been so much more. Sadly, the dungeon crawling experience is damaged by bad enemy AI, clunky controls and a terrible performance that make the experience very unpleasant. The game does have some interesting features and mechanics, as well as a well-done presentation, but they're not enough to make the game a must-have for those who aren't fans of the anime.",
"I'm all for retro compilations giving players the option of making games more accessible, so players can set their own experience. Rewind features in old arcade shooters and platformers are great. But imagine if a retro re-release of Castlevania (or whatever) made it impossible to fall down a gap or get killed by a boss by automatically rewinding the mistake. Now imagine they gave players no way of turning that off? To deny people an inherent, defining quality of a game in favour of something that fundamentally changes the experience, without completely redesigning the game so that the new experience makes sense... Nah, it hurts this to say because I love Monkey Ball, but this is all terribe decision-making by everyone involved.",
"Once Human excels at practically nothing, yet it is a thoroughly convincing free-to-play. Thanks to a map packed with points of interest, adrenaline-pumping and immediate combat, and crafting that is never too overwhelming, even those who usually steer clear of survival games might find Starry Studio's offering interesting. Unfortunately, the AI is woefully inadequate and artistically everything is really far too derivative to generate real interest.",
"The graphics range from okay to great and the colorful cast of characters inject infrequent doses of levity into the proceedings, even if some of the dialogue is two monkey jokes beyond eye-rollingly lame. [May 2004, p.82]",
"If you go into Valhalla Knights expecting a mindless, empty and soulless dungeon romp, then your expectations will be fulfilled. If that's what you want out of a game, Valhalla Knights delivers. However, if you foolishly come to this game anticipating a riveting story that propels the action with great characters and plot twists, expect to fall into a bottomless pit of frustration.",
DD's biggest failing is the audio. There are four different types of musical sets you can listen to while racing. They&#146;re all lame and performed by bands that are not known very well.,
"F1 2013 is the best F1 simulator of this generation and another great hit from Codemasters. It's a title that demands skill, tactics and commitment, but rewards players with a deep and satisfying experience. The AI and the damage systems might not be perfect, but it remains a great game with tons of content and options.",
"Simbin continues making money with almost 3 years old game engine, and it shows in everything. Graphics and physics are really old fashioned. Standards are set in much higher nowadays. Race On doesn't move sim fans, and looks too ugly to ""race"" with Forza Motorsport 3. Race On is not worth buying for full price. [Jan 2010]",
"For the 800 MSP price tag, it may seem a little on the high side for a 15 year old PC game, but if you liked it then and haven’t played it since, it would be a good buy especially for the new levels they added.",
"Your basic run-of-the-mill action game, which manages to entertain for a while. The controls are awkward and sadly the environments are not affected by the destruction and mayhem. The optional hero objective is a great idea. [June 2008]",
"Knowledge is Power is an entertaining quiz game, and based on my multiple playthroughs I’m yet to hit a question for the second time. It's Mario Kart-style item system ensures that most games are close, no matter the quiz knowledge. At the same time, the questions themselves are entertaining and varied enough that this one comes highly recommended for trivia heads.",
"The gameplay and exploration of Dead or School are surprisingly addictive, but enough small issues give me pause in fully recommending it. Grinding for levels, constantly upgrading your equipment, and completing sidequests for stat boosts are all practically required. It's very likely you'll encounter multiple final bosses that you simply aren't prepared for. Fortunately, many enemies respawn and save points refill your health and ammo, in addition to functioning as waypoints. Fanservice images pop up from time to time, but they aren't overly egregious and shouldn't dissuade you from a purchase. If you can look past its numerous imperfections, Dead or School is a satisfying and compelling albeit janky action-platformer that may be worth getting a hall pass for.",
"Part visual novel, part lightning-fast FPS platformer, Neon White's angst-ridden assassins are unbearable but its airtight level design and fantastic sense of momentum ensure its gameplay is something to celebrate.",
"If Ritual can improve the plotting of future chapters, add more variety to the enemies and weapons and maybe make the game a tad longer per episode (we would have preferred six to eight hours for the price) we could see this becoming a successful new way to present PC games.",
"It's not often that a tactics game asks you to do anything other than lie in hiding and carrying out carefully thought-out assassinations. Hard West 2 does. Here it's all about getting as much as possible done in one round, and the art of combining the characteristics of the characters with the highly engaging Bravado system makes the game an engaging experience.",
"I can look past your repetitive combat, formulaic structure and sometimes misleading game design. It's your stylish presentation, puzzles and ability to mess with a guy's head that's gonna make me own you. Literally. [Sept 2002, p.161]",
"A dungeon crawler RPG with a little bit of fetish and a very unique battle-system. If you enjoy dungeon-crawling RPG games and sexy anime, take a quick look at Criminal Girls: Invite Only.",
"This is, undeniably, the worst version of RPG Maker, which is, by itself, the best tool to create simple RPGs on PC. No tutorial, a lack of content and a high price hold this product back.",
"Even with all these hiccups, there’s still a solid combination of adventuring and fighting to be found here. And the sense of progression--going from a lowly no-skilled friendless ninja to a super awesome friendless ninja--is handled well in terms of what powers you get and when you get them.",
"The management and simulation of trains is still fun, and in this game it is also enriched by the development of cities and the addition and improvement of buildings. The complex extensive campaign will be appreciated mainly by creative and at the same time patient players.",
"Jupiter Hell doesn’t need the word Doom in the title to make an impact, but it’s commendable how well it presents DRL through modern design. At its heart, it’s a turn-based dungeon-crawler RPG, but that doesn’t calm my nerves when I’m blasting through a hallway of enemies from around the corner with more approaching from behind. This game’s launch version is serviceable, but the lack of enemy variety will leave your first hours of gameplay feeling repetitive in some areas. Still, it’s clear that there’s more on the way for this standout roguelike experience, and I’m all here for it.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is the roadtrip holiday I’ve really needed after two years in and out of COVID-induced lockdowns. It brings me great solace to be behind the wheel, covering hundreds of kilometers of distance across an awe-inspiring piece of Earth. And even when I’m careening through the mud on a cross-country race, crashing into strangers on the internet, my mind is in an untroubled, fulfilling place. In 2021, Forza Horizon 5 is where I want to be.",
"As an extension of ""The Sims"" as a franchise it categorically fails to engage, and even just squeaks through on a technical level. No amount of glitz is going to cover that up. It's not bad, per se, but there's no way anyone with a heavy, eclectic interest in videogames should be spending £40 on this.",
"With a larger career mode featuring more cities and greater tracks, additional gameplay modes and rock solid online play, this is the racer you want to cross the finish line with in your gaming console.",
"Still, if you're a hardcore Dynasty Warriors fan or you're easily enthralled by the idea of mindless hack and slash gameplay, then Strikeforce is a decent enough game. But if you're looking for a more complex battle or can't stand Dynasty Warriors, this title won't change your mind.",
"We don’t mind a Castlevania fighting game when it’s done right but Judgment just isn’t able to pull it off well thanks to a number of problems that make this a unimpressive fighting game. All is not bad, though, seeing as the collection of characters bring something different to the battle, but it’s not enough to recommend this one.",
"In a medium full of spaceships and crumbling castles, The Thaumaturge is a singular sojourn to a time and place that many players will be unfamiliar with, presenting a dance through the sights and sounds of a turn-of-the-century Warsaw imbued with magic and terrifying creatures. Backed up by a solid combat system, compelling main narrative and diverging decision points, this supernatural adventure is one well worth taking.",
"I’d recommend Hard West 2 to just about anyone, even if you’ve never played the genre before. Some early growing pains are easily overcome and there’s just the right amount of tactics, exploration, story, and atmosphere. While not a revolutionary take on the mechanics, it’s a solid offering on all fronts.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles is a fantastic game. It has some feelings of Final Fantasy XII, but at the same time, feels unlike any other game. The combat is complex and challenging, exploration is both fun and rewarding, and the story and world is something to be seen. Fans of the original game can still have a blast here and people who never tried it before on Wii or 3DS should most certainly pick this one up. This is one of those RPG that will be on top 10 lists for years.",
"It was definitely a nice change of pace from the standard World War II/sci-fi settings and until someone does it better, Bound in Blood is, in my opinion, the best Western-themed shooter around.",
"It may have the Fate name in its title, but it doesn't present itself like a Fate title. The Umbral Star tells a bonkers story that only a Fate franchise can produce. The game itself is fun and features some awesome animations, but it’s instantly dragged down by terrible team AI and almost no sense of accomplishment.",
"This is absolutely not the blockbuster you are waiting for, but still it's an entertaining game that keeps you busy for a few hours. The action is there all the time and so are the many many clichés.",
"Finally we got an entertaining Spider-Man game, although a few months extra polish probably would have given it higher grades. Shattered Dimensions is still good fun with a lot of variation for all ages.",
"Tech Support: Error Unknown is a short little game, quick to play, easy to digest, and honestly, compelling enough to make me want to find out what happens next. I did a single playthrough, myself, and tried the slightly harder modes, which I didn’t see much of a difference in, but maybe that would become more apparent further down the road. I think, though, that the developers have a lot of unresolved issues from their time at the Help Desk prison and I think I want to hug them. I know I need a hug after that.",
"Following FIFA's path, EA improved Madden keeping in mind the most important thing: the gameplay. It is deep, interaction is great, the action bring to an experience that you can feel in any other sport title of the publisher. There wasn't the hurry to find something new with Madden, but the work done is great anyway.",
"Mugen Souls refines and improves the combat system of Compile Heart's previous games with unique ideas and game mechanics. Besides its poor graphics and repetitive ship battles, it's a recommended game for anyone who had fun with Hyperdimension Neptunia.",
"A digital board game that puts you in a role of one of greedy, corrupted gremlins that fight each other over power and money. With intelligent design, amazing artwork and easy to grasp rules, this is a game worth buying. If only it wasn't lacking local multiplayer.",
"The legacy mode is rewarding and the gameplay is predominantly solid, but a plethora of bugs and some AI issues ensure it won't supplant EA's game as the reigning champ this season.",
"Heavily inspired by Demon's Souls and Nioh, The First Berserker: Khazan may lack depth in its narrative and feel somewhat uninspired in terms of level design, but it still leaves a mark thanks to its great combat system and some fantastic boss fights. Despite a few excessive difficulty spikes, it remains enjoyable for the most part.",
"GRIP has great racing mechanics, but they’re marred by inconsistent implementation. As a spiritual successor to a turn of the century combat racing IP that only a select few would recognise – Rollcage – it’s best enjoyed in short bursts. Its familiar simplicity is inherently appealing, and its well-polished mechanics make racing fun for an hour or two. As you get your fill of the main mode and begin to delve deeper beneath the surface, however, it becomes apparent that there isn’t much to keep you coming back for more. GRIP has an incredibly solid framework, but it still feels like it’s missing something.",
"If you’re on the market for a dramatic and original episodic series with unique gameplay mechanics and an intriguing story to tell, then consider checking out Life is Strange. I definitely need to reiterate how impressed I am with Dontnod Entertainment's first foray into the episodic adventure genre, and we're definitely excited to see where they'll be taking us next.",
"The overall package for Majora's Mask 3D preserves all the weird delight of the original game while lowering the barrier of entry for new players. There's still a lot that's challenging about the puzzles and fights, but a few minor tweaks make your hard-won heart containers and masks feel that much more satisfying.",
"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is no doubt one of the best games for Nintendo DS in months. It's original, exciting and brilliant in some of its puzzle mechanics, while the plot and the characters are beautifully developed. It doesn't last too much, but the overall experience is worth it.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a fantastic game that has some of the best bosses of any Soulslike ever created. It's a game that will test patience and demand the utmost attention from the player, or else they'll meet the game over screen time and time again. This Soulslike is absolutely brutal, and yet, it remains fair throughout its 40-hour runtime. While the levels begin to blend in with one another aesthetically and the overwhelming amount of loot can become exhausting, The First Berserker: Khazan is a welcomed addition to the subgenre and I can't wait to see what developer Neople has planned next for this new IP.",
"It's the little things that add up to make F1 2013 feel a cut above the previous game. Revised handling, more gameplay modes and the new tyre and rule changes definitely add a lot of depth.",
This could be that rare case in which a game inspires players to give their well worn controllers a break and pick up a paperback for a few nights instead. That alone makes Metro: Last Light worth putting on your wish list.,
"Telltale delivers a great sandbox with a charming story. There is enough here to make adults giggle and kids run amok. It is truly amazing how much of a fan service this is to fans of LEGO. A lacking multiplayer is the worst omission, and even with this in mind, this is easily one of TT’s best LEGO games ever. There is tons of collectibles (with some great references and cross promotion of actual LEGO sets). A must have for Wii U owners and a great game on its own.",
"It's not nearly as fun to play as it is to watch in cutscene form. The game tries to emulate the vibe and humor of Psychonauts, but doesn't come close to that title's wit or personality.",
"While it’s unfortunate that Freedom shipped without an online mode, the single-player campaign and multiplayer mode have enough content to produce more than 100 hours of gameplay. It’s one of the longest, most involved titles on the system.",
"Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a great arcade title, a spin-off that lets us know Alan Wake a little more despite the presence of a not-very-compelling storyline. Both graphics and sound meet the high expectations, while the presence of a ""Horde"" mode is useful to spend a few hours of fun even after the conclusion of the main story. A certain repetitiveness, especially after the first two or three hours, causes big damage to the final gaming experience.",
"Despite some rough edges and a forgettabole single player component, Starship Troopers: Extermination perfectly captures the big battles of the movie in a way that will have fans coming back for a long time to come.",
"It's still far from perfect - clumsy controls, long loading times and disappointing minigames see to that - but Sherlock Holmes' newest videogame adventure is still a lot of fun, mainly due to the interesting cases that keep taking things in unexpected directions.",
"High Moon's love for the subject matter clearly shines through, so it's a shame that Fall of Cybertron stumbles in a few areas. Transformers fans will still have a blast with the game, but underneath the chrome chassis this is just another compentent shooter. Fall of Cybertron falls short of finally doing the Transformers universe justice, but although it may be faint praise, it is definitely the best Transformers game yet.",
"Nintendo has succeeded in delivering a feeling of nostalgia with this NEW Super Mario Bros. Wii, but still also managing innovation. Adding multiplayer makes it even more perfect. We can be straight to the point: New Super Mario Bros Wii is one of the best titles on the Wii. Comes highly recommended.",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is probably the weakest of the Kingdom Hearts collections to date. Since it's bundled with a single game, a demo, and a borderline-incoherent selection of cut scenes, the content is far behind the other Kingdom Hearts HD ports. The content is mostly good, and the Ground Zeroes-style demo for Kingdom Hearts 3 is sure to entice fans. It has more original content than the previous collections, but it's still not worth the $60 asking price. Kingdom Hearts fans will be happy to get some time with the newest entry in the series, but casual players might want to wait for a price drop.",
"This latest Namco Museum features enough fantastic games to delight both long-time gamers and the retro-curious. After all these years, it's great to see Namco still putting together incredible compilations and digging up a few buried treasures in the process.",
"At last Firefall came out from its everlasting beta period, as a solid MMO/TPS meant to be played with a small group of friend. It's not a revolution, but has its interesting peculiarities.",
"A fun experience whilst it lasts, Urban Trial Playground provides some solid motorbike action on the Switch. The sunny setting is the perfect backdrop for this laid-back, yet sufficiently challenging game.",
"In the crowded puzzle genre, especially on a handheld like the 3DS, Minis on the Move doesn't stand out in any significant way. There is no impressive gameplay twist, no mechanic that feels fresh or noteworthy. It may attempt to mesh hectic action with mind-bending challenges, but it doesn't particularly succeed at either.",
"When trying to sum up this game's single-player missions, the first phrases that come to mind are hopelessly outnumbered, completely surrounded, and best hide behind a big rock quick.",
"Monochroma looks great, and it wants gamers to get highly intoxicated by its extraordinary variety of emotions. However, even the most beautiful stylization of the world cannot fix imprecise movement of characters in a genre where perfect accuracy is essential. With a considerable amount of irritating puzzles Monochroma is thus the perfect recipe for tantrums.",
"The story and the relationships with companions could’ve been done better, but combat in Hard West 2 is excellent. Action points reset mechanic, interesting skills, card system and well-designed items make for well though out, engaging encounters.",
"It's not a crap title. However, the sport of soccer doesn't translate as well as basketball to this arcade style of play. The fun factor isn't as high. This is partially due to the over-emphasis on tricks, which remove the actual game of soccer, and it's also due to the game's mechanics.",
"It manages to fit some of the series' feel into one of the most generic genres ever. Unfortunately, severe play issues limit its playability, and very few gamers of any age will get to enjoy some of the extras that Tomy took the time to add in.",
"For a small independent game without much pretension, Trek to Yomi does it with all the honors. The fights are maybe a bit basic and the journey is a bit short, but the replayability it offers allows to extend the experience, and its aesthetics is just great. If you like Kurosawa's cinema, the Edo period and the bushido code, it should definitely delight you.",
"A slower episode that sacrifices action for more character development, Telltale’s Batman game is shaping up to not only redefine the dark knight but also his greatest nemesis as Bruce Wayne finds himself caught up in a dangerous game.",
But the Story Mode is just plain broken; directing with the Move and actually moving with either the left analog stick of the wireless DS3 or the Nav controller doesn't work well at all. It's just unbelievably irritating.,
"The action is tremendously addictive and will keep you coming back for more. The most pleasant surprise was the mature plot and gruesome execution both literally and figuratively. It deals with the nature of war, the heavy toll it inflicts and those callous opportunists who see it as a business and humans as merely a commodity.",
Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a delightful little game that can appeal to players of all ages and skill levels. The island of Gemea – complete with its atmospheric weather and seasonal cycle – makes for the perfect destination if you're looking for a relaxing virtual vacation.,
"Viewing this title from an adult perspective is wrong. After watching my son play for a number of hours, I can tell I'd be bored to tears with repetitiveness of the whole thing -- fighting, leveling-up, feeding the dragon, fighting, and repeat. But as proven by at least one player, this could very well appeal to the pre-teen gamer in your house.",
"It’s clear that some effort certainly went into this dastardly devil’s creation, but Vergil’s Downfall leaves us wanting more; the inability to play as Vergil in the main campaign, much less the recently released Bloody Palace mode, is a puzzling omission given the precedent set with Devil May Cry 3.",
"Neon White was designed with a clear philosophy in mind and it shows. It’s about smooth movement, interesting level design, creative puzzle solutions and most of all, speed. Those looking for a shooter may be disappointed, but players who are looking for the aforementioned attributes will certainly not be. Amusing characters and a lighthearted tone are just icing on the cake on this very well-designed platformer. If you enjoy the game’s first level, then you likely won’t be dropping Neon White any time soon.",
"Hard West 2 is a sequel we didn’t know we wanted. It’s XCOM-esque gameplay is enriched with the especially fresh mechanic of bravado, which leads to a completely unique approach at the shootouts. That’s no small feat for a subgenre where its rules of engagement are deeply embedded to the past.",
"Apart from the disappointing lack of a single-cart download option for multiplayer, it's a solid and enjoyable puzzle game that challenges and frustrates but never for reasons that detract from the game's appeal.",
"The Indie gamer’s dream, Revita is sure to be a hit with many people. Never knowing what each run will hold makes it easy to keep going back, especially for the completionist who wants to find all of the secrets and unlock all of the things!",
"In Firefall the clear line is missing. The game was changed so frequently during its long development time, and re-designed, that it's just mixed way up from many individual ideas in the end, but not really in harmony as a complete work.",
"For now, I think it means you're better off sticking with Arma II. Underwater missions, accomplished vehicle physics, an impressive array of player stances and fantastic visuals can't make up for a too-big map full of nothing and a handful of missions most computers and servers can't fully handle. I'll tell you what though, Arma III is going to be a great game in 2015.",
"Like many of my piratical favourites, King of Seas doesn’t take itself too seriously, and as a result makes it a fun game for casual players. My main gripe is that the side quests aren’t varied enough and do get a touch monotonous. Unfortunately, they are the quickest way to gaining experience when grinding through the levels is required. But that said, sailing across the map is a relaxing experience, with King of Seas allowing would-be-pirates to play the game their own way. Simple controls, and fun story, and enjoyable gameplay mean that it is a game for all wannabe swashbucklers.",
"It's about time a packaged, mostly complete, somewhat enhanced version of the original classic puzzler was made available and, despite the slight gripes, there's still countless hours of puzzle fun to be had in this economic, attractive package.",
"I just can't find any redeeming qualities in this game. It's not overly exciting, it looks almost exactly like the original Grand Theft Auto, only much smaller, and the game lacks any humor or interesting content.",
"If you are a SEGA nut like me, you will adore many aspects found in SEGA Superstars Tennis. You will also leave the experience however wanting more in both single player and online.",
"The story isn’t worth a second of your time. A crappy story makes for a crappy RPG. Artistically Square Enix is on par with their top titles (""Final Fantasy,"" ""Parasite Eve"" and ""Xenogears"" excluded – they're still the best). But no matter what I do I can't get past the story.",
"The game has been previously available in a free PC build, but the 3DS version has the benefit of a professional translation and optimization for the 3DS, where the GamePad and buttons feel very much like the old-school NES controller as one plays.",
"SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE is superb. The core of it is even better than its predecessor, in fact, by virtue of identifying how to expand on it in a way that truly makes sense. The new abilities not only slot in beautifully; there’s a sense that they bring out more of what is inherently part of the design.",
"It has a lot of what FF fans have come to expect – high quality presentation, a grand adventure, a likeable cast, and lots of fighting. But, it also has a lot changes to which not everyone may warm up – gambits, revamped battle system, and a different way of storytelling.",
"Puzzle Bobble EveryBubble! is the classic puzzle tried and tested, but with new types of bubbles, puzzles, challenges and the incentive that almost all the content, except the online part, can be enjoyed by up to 4 simultaneous players. Even with this new elements, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it is still a safe bet for fans of the genre.",
"It’s easy to see why this is a cult classic. BIOMOTOR UNITRON is a retro RPG done right. While it can be something of a grind, it offers more depth than you might think. And considering an original NGPC cart commands triple-digit pricing, this eShop release is a steal at only $7.99. So, if you’re a fan of dungeon crawlers, this sci-fi take shouldn’t be missed.",
"For me, the infectious old-school vibe and the fact that it delivers a ton of nerve-wracking situations were enough to make me ignore any frustration I have with the less-than-perfect execution. [Sept 2003, p.120]",
"Neon White is going to make more than a few people realize they’re speedrunners at heart. Its brand of competition with the self is enthralling, and it's lifted to greater heights by its presentation, music, and mechanics.",
"What truly holds Concord back is its lack of identity. A story or campaign would have been a great way to showcase the world, its characters and lore, yet all of that is stuffed into the Galactic Guide that few players will probably ever read. The Freegunners and game modes are fun and mostly balanced, though feel derivative when stacked up against the already established competition. Meanwhile, map design feels safe with layouts that don’t encourage much experimentation. Concord is a good, fun game from a brand-new studio that’s currently missing its identity. It may be a bit lost in space, but Concord checks off enough boxes to hopefully chart a path forward.",
"Trek to Yomi’s opening chapter really builds expectation for what will follow, but what does follow doesn’t live up to that promise. It’s a gorgeous game to watch, but the gameplay simply falls short of matching the quality of the visuals.",
"Vicarious Visions and Blizzard Entertainment have done something amazing with Diablo II: Resurrected. It is much more than a tribute. It is a sign that the first game is unrepeatable and that it remains so fresh despite the years (at least for some, because it is evident that it aged particularly badly). Therefore, Diablo II: Resurrected is a careful recommendation. It is a game for veterans of the original, fans and curious.",
"A satisfying role-playing experience, as long as you know what you're getting yourself into. Hardcore players may actually lament the slight ease in difficulty and the fact that the game doesn't give them the character development freedom it really should. But as far as portable RPGs go, you could do a lot worse than Hoshigami.",
"It's a good thing the game is all about speed, because the framerate is rock steady. The various mountains are bursting with creativity. Rider animations are oddly cartoony and occasionally you'll get snagged on an object, but for the most part the physics make sense and the game looks good.",
"The Thaumaturge’s biggest problems are a result of trying to do so many different things at once. It’s a juggling act on the best of days, and if you’re a working-class person in 1900s Poland you aren’t having a bunch of great days. Not consistently, anyway. This is a deeply interesting game with a lot of cool imagery, historical storytelling hooks and complex systems that are a blast to engage with. There are a ton of swings, and not every one is a hit. Sometimes the voice acting is wacky, the protagonist feels underdeveloped, and combat can be annoying and burdensome. But I also accidentally stayed up way past my adult, parent bedtime on multiple nights playing it. I feel and probably look like Wiktor after catching a new Salutor, but it was worth it.",
"Melbits World is a charming puzzle-solver for party-time. With the power of PlayLink, you will overcome obstacles with up to three friends by using cell phones and tablets to control bridges, boxes, barriers, and beyond. While some of obstacles taking advantage of motion controls can be a bit sluggish, this approach of controls means that no one is left out of the party. Melbits World is an all-ages romp of madcap mayhem for all skill levels which places a high priority on player communication.",
"PS2 owners without a PSP or 360 should get this in a heartbeat, but know that you’re getting some really worn-out hand-me-downs. PS2 owners with a PSP or 360 should stick to the games on those platforms.",
"For something intended to be played many times, Error Unknown has a tendency to drag on. It would have benefitted from tightening up, each ‘run’ lasting fewer days in order to maximise novelty and minimise repetition. But despite having more than a few bugs in its execution, Tech Support: Error Unknown just about qualifies as a minimum viable product. Ticket completed.",
The most important positive point about Final Fantasy XIII-2 is that the gameplay has been strongly improved. New features like Paradigm Shift and Mog Clock are a really good addition to the game. Final Fantasy XIII-2 has a nice story but unfortunately not as epic as we expected.,
"Astroy Boy assaults you with old-school charm. Factor in snazzy visuals, tight controls, and demanding difficulty, and you get a solid purchase...and one that's not just for kids. [Sept 2004, p.110]",
"Madden 10’s improvements also highlight just how rusty the A.I. has gotten over the years. Spit and polish have taken the series far over the last two decades, but this is the first sign that maybe a more substantial revision is due.",
"The cut-scenes add a nice touch to the storyline, and the nearly limitless number of enemy bugs; matched with their hard armor and aggressive behavior defiantly keep the game, if nothing else, interesting.",
"Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time is truly a terrible video game. There are signs of mediocrity between the seams, but it operates on such a fundamentally flawed level that it turns into a wrestling match between my sanity and its systems. I don’t know if it runs noticeably better on a PS4 Pro or the PC version, but an increase in technical performance does not excuse it of all the flaws in its design. I consider myself a fan of Little Witch Academia and Chamber of Time sometimes made me wish that I wasn’t.",
"With a nice story and hours of strategy to create, you can not go wrong with this game. I found myself wanting to see the next part of the story even though I knew 3 hours of sleep was not going to get me through the day.",
"The improved out-of-car experience, better gun handling, added driving-and-shooting mechanic, and the slew of changes all culminate in this being a much better outing that ""Driver 3.""",
"FC25 is an improvement on the previous entry, moving in a positive direction. Ultimate Team continues to be egregious, but Rush is refreshing and fun. Refocusing its gameplay to a more deliberate and slower paced brand of football, that takes tactics into account, makes for a more enjoyable game. With some minor updates, its potential can be fulfilled. FC25 has found its form, and is the best an EA footie title has been in years.",
"South of Midnight comes out swinging with an incredible story, but the gameplay just isn’t there to back it up. If you love a good story and an awesome soundtrack, it’s still worth a look.",
"One thing that I was kind of disappointed about with King Arthur is the fact that it goes by too damn quick. You basically hack and slash your enemies until the end, and that is pretty much what the game comes down too; hacking and slashing.",
"In fact, the game is almost as dull as listening to NPR (almost), but since it's so mercifully short, the credits will be rolling before you realize just how little fun you're having.",
"Revengeance boasts neither the deep combat of Bayonetta, nor the measured nuance of a Metal Gear Solid either...But for those that manage to break through its barriers and work around its lack of intuitiveness, it's a rampageous feast for the eyes and thumbs - even if it is a slice or two short of perfection.",
"The kind of 4X that brings my relationship with strategy games to a lofty peak. It is engaging and yet oddly meditative, almost relaxing to play rather than nerve-wracking and brain-frying.",
"If you've already played a Mario Kart game, Double Dash is still worth days of your time. However, it might lose its appeal sooner than other versions did, because for ninety percent it's just more of the same.",
"From bedrooms containing clever and mysterious moving panels to a 'Land of the Giants'-style pool challenge, each section delivers something new and exciting to motivate deeper exploration. [Apr 2004, p.110]",
"Capcom loves Capcom and this is what you're gonna find out playing this strange and fascinating DLC. But if you plan to play it alone, think twice, as it could turn out to be a rather boring experience.",
"A Space for the Unbound rotates between visual novel scenes, fetch quests, quick-time-event fights and increasingly complex puzzles. It moves along at a steady pace, but gives space for the player to breathe when things get heavy. There's always a stray cat to pet if you need a moment to recover.",
"Ikenfell likely won’t replace the Harry Potter series as a whole when it comes to providing a signature web of tales centered around a magic school, but it still provides one impressive journey on its own. Filled with lovable characters, an enjoyable story, and a colorful world to explore filled with a nice level of challenge and a stunning soundtrack, there’s a lot here for fantasy and RPG fans to check out. Heck, it may even be something to recommend to younger gamers as an introduction to the tactics subgenre. Overall, Ikenfell is a trip to a far-out school that’s definitely worth taking.",
Nothing you've played previously will properly prepare you for the authentic and often distressing portrayal of aerial warfare served up by Microprose in B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th. Never has a title so humanized the genre or brought it to such a personal level.,
It’s hard to believe that EA’s Madden NFL 2010 is the 5th Madden release on the Xbox 360. Each incarnation has built upon and improved on the previous. Madden 2009 made the series and the sport itself accessible to the masses – so how much room has the latest release got to move?,
"The Devil’s Daughter pushes deeper the boundaries of crime investigations, however it’s not supported by an appropriate main narrative context. The low quality of action sequences also creates some problems like poor interactions and overblown loading times.",
"Rainbow Skies is the new game from SideQuest Studios, and an indirect sequel to Rainbow Moon. This is an old-school tactical RPG with tons of quest and characters to collect and develop.",
"Pulse takes a distinctively different approach to blindness than Beyond Eyes. And while I welcome the gaming aspects that give you a sense of danger the audiovisual concept is hardly more than a tech-demo – a very arduous one, which makes the short playtime even sweeter.",
American Nightmare does some great tricks in telling the story but fails to deliver the same immersive and thrilling experience as Alan Wake. But as it offers far more interesting fights with (finally!) a lot more different enemies it still is a really good action game!,
"The first part of Lost Records does a great job of building anticipation for the second, thanks to its well-written characters and slow-paced yet engaging story. While there are some issues, both big and small, that need to be addressed, the overall experience remains promising.",
"If, like us, you love the hidden objects genre, then you’re going to be right at home with Clockwork Tales Of Glass and Ink. If you’re new to puzzle titles then there can be no better introduction than this gem of a game.",
"Despite its apparent unoriginality, Close to the Sun is actually striking and fresh. Don’t let its clear BioShock influences fool you into thinking it’s derivative. It may not be the most consistent experience, but it’s certainly a memorable one. If you’re a fan of strong world-building, spooky atmospheres, and engaging mysteries, it’s worth looking past some of Close to the Sun’s glaring issues.",
"Super Mutant Alien Assault isn't the greatest shooter in recent memory, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's just really fun to play. And there's plenty of depth tucked away for you to discover the more you play.",
"It has all the virtues we can expect from an indie game. If you're going to play with friends you'll make the most of it, since playing on your own makes the game losing some of its appeal.",
"Black Book is a unique mix of point-and-click adventure and fun card-based deck-building RPG taking place in a unique setting with interesting characters. There are certain shortcomings in translation and lack of explanation when it comes to the game’s systems, but overall it is an incredibly enjoyable narrative-driven experience.",
"While it’s a bit too short to realize its full potential, Boyfriend Dungeon is still a well written and fun visual novel/dungeon crawler. The characters are lovely, and combat is simple but functional. It’s certainly worth playing, but could use more content.",
"Dancing All Night is full of spirit and celebration unparalleled in the series thus far. Despite the dark and implausible story in the background, Dancing All Night is a concentrated dose of the most uplifting, cheerful, and fun side of the series, all set to a fantastic soundtrack that will get anyone dancing.",
"This game looks amazing, thanks to the beautiful artwork. It also offers a nice experience with the tale of a blind girl searching for a red cat. However, it's all a bit too simple.",
"A simple platform game, clearly thought for mobile gaming and not completely suited for a home console. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and the remixed levels are pretty challenging.",
"Sorry We’re Closed not only pays homage to classic survival horror, it provides a truly unique love story that delves into the very nature of romance itself. For all its theming and grisly imagery, however, there’s a script with a pointed sense of humor and a cast of fun characters to match. Combat has good ideas set back by some awkward implementation, but the moments of annoyance aren’t enough to pull down the sum of all parts.",
"Imagine Buzz, but more colorful, with more ways to play and controlled with a phone. We’ve had a great time playing with friends, and if you enjoy this type of quiz show-like game, it’s worth your money.",
"The huge time investment required to make anything that resembles progress means that this is hardly the best place for newcomers to start but by stark contrast, there's no better Yu-Gi-Oh! title on the market in terms of card lists, AI and sheer longevity.",
"The graphics, however, are the game's strongest suit. Viggo's Revenge sports the same cartoony characters and environments as the DC version, but they have been a tad improved thanks to cell shading technology.",
"Monster Energy Supercross 25 is a solid entry that refines previous installments, yet it still has room to grow if it wants to leave a truly memorable mark on the genre. It is a competent and technically advanced offering, although its modes are conservative and its visual presentation could be better.",
"As an educational tool, Beyond Eyes did a great job of teaching me of the struggles people face when their vision is impaired... As a game though, Beyond Eyes is about plodding through a maze with barely any meaningful plot until right at the end.",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 The Final Chapter Prologue is an atypical collection: on one hand able to enchant with Dream Drop Distance, for gameplay and for the graphics, but on the other hand it doesn't impress with Birth by Sleep 0.2. The Back Cover film, then, doesn't transmit great feelings.",
"Some new additions to the gameplay makes this title more than a simple Vita conversion, and great for those who never picked up the original. Still, if you already own it on the PS3 there is nothing that new to warrant a new purchase unless you need an RPG on the Vita or are a seasoned trophy hunter.",
"The track designs in Double Dash are positively bursting with activity. If you thought Mario Kart was intense on the N64 (with it's notoriously cheap catch-up AI-which I'm happy to report is noticeably absent this time), you ain't seen nothing yet!",
"It might be easy to say that Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is simply a pair of remastered games that can't compare to more modern platformers, but that's only half-true. Although their relatively low sales and cult status meant that the formula wasn't really given the chance to evolve, almost anyone can still jump into these games and have a good time. The lack of meaningful new content on par with Klonoa's Wii remake from 2008 is disappointing, but the content that is here is still worthwhile. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a nice offering to underserviced fans, and can also be a good package for newcomers - or even people who are picking up a platformer for the first time.",
"In the end, Grip has all the prerequisite gameplay and technical elements. Yet the randomness of the environments and the clunky air handling left little to be desired. It almost feels like a game of chance instead one involving skill. I’ll give it solid marks for the technical aspects but the randomness of the gameplay left me cold. It’s worth a try as you may feel differently.",
"A game not afraid to take chances and have fun with itself. The atmosphere is excellent, thanks to a great cinematic score and a great variety of gameplay including horses, dueling, stealth and flat-out action.",
"No pun intended, but Part Time UFO is the very definition of a pick-up-and-play effort. You know… pick up… with a claw… Ahem! Anyway, it's rewarding for short bursts and designed very well for this kind of play, with a level of polish not found in some other 'short burst' titles. It also saves some of its best surprises for the endgame.",
"Sonic Colours is a worthy successor of the saga we have learned to love in the 90's. Quick and easy to master, the game brings a lot of fun and it's really enjoyable by all kind of players.",
"A Total War Saga: Troy is an excellent new addition to the Total War franchise, and while it may seem small in comparison to some of its predecessors, its attention to detail and strong art and design choices are more than enough to make this a memorable entry. Fans will find new and interesting challenges in the new features but will find comfort in the strong tactical gameplay that had been honed to perfection over the past 20 years.",
"A digital board game in a purest form, with interesting, deep rules and nice art style. What bothered me was that it was not always immediately clear what happened during opponents’ rounds and I often spent more time analyzing their past movements than planning mine. [05/2016, p.52]",
"With a lame story and boring gameplay, I got tired of Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex in a hurry. There's also a noticeable lack of polish, with things like maps and clear objective descriptors being absent.",
"Definitely aimed at the younger audiences, The Incredibles is an adequate but unremarkable action game on its own. The license certainly does help thanks to Pixar's unique charm and the game includes a variety of movie footage and trailers to please fans of the film.",
Sadly the challenge mode is still a hindrance to being able to play alongside friends with the service rarely functioning or challenges disappearing. It still looks like we’ll be waiting until a proper sequel for this to be updated.,
"NBA 2K23 is the Michael Jordan of the basketball games. Stunning visuals, improved gameplay and the additions of Eras to the MyNBA mode and the Jordan Challenges make it a must-have for basketball fans. The only issue with NBA 2K23 is an old one: microtransactions. But, if you're a 2K fan, you already know that.",
"Concord largely nails the fundamentals - it feels highly responsive, is handsomely made, has good feeling, if slower gunplay than other games, super stable servers and minor concerns aside, has a roster of mostly well balanced characters. With Concord's obviously passionate team of developers confirming that they are absolutely in it for “years to come”, I would love for Concord to still be around in one, two or three years time and even beyond that. I just don't know if gamers who have been experiencing varying amounts of genre fatigue will be generous enough to put a significant amount of time into a title that, on the starting blocks at least, seems roundly decent enough but doesn't offer anything thunderously new to upset the status quo. I know that I'll be playing Concord in the weeks and months to come, I'm just not sure a sufficient number of other folks will be joining me.",
"Whether you are a fan of the Fate series or an anime fan, players will enjoy this great addition to the franchise as well as the quirkiness of some of its characters. For players new to the series but are fans of the Dynasty Warriors style games, Fate/Extella has plenty of entertainment value to offer with its strong story and sound gameplay.",
"Without being the most exciting, original or accomplished rogue-like of the genre, Gwent: Rogue Mage nevertheless offers a recipe that works, all in the familiar universe of The Witcher. Players who like the modern recipe of CD Projekt Red's TCG, but prefer to play solo, should enjoy it for a while, especially since its price is really modest. However, the alterations made to the gameplay may put off some players, and it quickly feels like they are doing the same thing over and over again.",
"Madden 25 emerges as a strong continuation of the series, combining stellar player models and environments with an overall improved on-field experience. It’s not perfect by any means, but when compared to Madden entries over the last ten years, Madden 25 easily sits at the top. Though, I understand that the bar wasn’t set very high in the first place. With College Football 25 being a ton of fun and Madden 25 taking a large step in the right direction, I can safely say that I’m excited for what’s to come. See you on the gridiron.",
"The gameplay in Game of Thrones is a bit more passive than most games and might be difficult to follow for people new to the franchise, but it does offer a strong story that fits right into the Game of Thrones lore. It has the same fantastic way of taking you into this fantasy world filled with surprising and shocking moments.",
A diamond in the rough... The dreadful Saturn-caliber graphics and crappy sounds are tolerable once the fun of exploring other character&#146;s dreams (ala the 3D free-roaming portions of &#147;NiGHTS&#148;) is experienced.,
"Playing as Billy isn’t bad but you’ll start feeling like Reverend Ray should have been the real star of the game. In the end, the single-player game just doesn’t hold a candle to the enjoyable online multiplayer.",
"A nice little take on a strategy RPG. In truth it's probably one of Idea Factory's best efforts released here in the States, melding staples of the genre with more open, zippy little ideas.",
"Sometimes, you just want to log on, and kill people with fireballs. Forge is there for this and this only; it's like World of Warcraft Battlegrounds without World of Warcraft wrapped around the battlegrounds. Even though the game isn't nearly as polished as it should, it's worth a glance for people looking for that specific kind of arena experience.",
"There's a great arcade flight sim in here somewhere. Vector Thrust offers a huge number of unlockable planes, thrilling dogfights and a bevy of modes, but its abysmal campaign and wildly inconsistent quality should have been caught in Early Access.",
"Activating the showboating feature gives you the chance to make a spectacular behind-the-back catch of a routine fly ball, but...the joys of fielding end there. When you aren't overrunning the ball, you're stuck in molasses trying to turn back to get it.",
"The sound effects, music, and gameplay in Electronic Symphony fuse together to form an addictive and aurally pleasing experience. For better or worse, these are the same things I've enjoyed about Lumines since its debut. Even wrapped in some new features and an excellent soundtrack, it's just more Lumines. This musical puzzler is a solid choice for new Vita owners, but it isn't a must-have title in the larger gaming landscape.",
"In the end, if you're looking for a fighting game for your brand new console, than Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is quite an engaging game that offers a considerable amount of replay value.",
"Alwa’s Legacy is an excellent example of how to do a proper sequel; it takes everything that the original did well and builds on it, adds in a few new ideas of its own, and corrects the issues that were previously present. It may be a little on the short side, but Alwa’s Legacy is the special sort of game that only comes around once in a great while, reminding you of the kind of quality that’s possible when a dedicated crew puts in the time to make a polished and tightly designed final product. The best Metroidvania on Switch? That’s entirely subjective, of course, but those of you who enjoy the genre owe it to yourselves to give this a try.",
"Vampire The Masquerade Blood Hunt doesn't revolutionize the battle royal style, but brings some fresh new features thanks to a solid level design and nice gameplay options. A good BR game, a bit different from what we are now used to play.",
"Even the most cynical gamers will have a hard time not being won over by its charms. In short, it's the type of game you bought a GameCube for in the first place and, thanks to its excellent multiplayer modes, has a lot of staying power.",
"Röki is a beautiful tale of love, loss and friendship, taking the player on an emotional journey through a fairytale forest inspired by Scandinavian folklore. If you enjoy challenging puzzles, engaging narratives and collectible-hunting, this is the game for you - but do be warned that the ending may leave you feeling a little underwhelmed.",
"If you’re willing to forego the story and just enjoy the action, Fate Extella is undoubtedly one of the smoothest playing Warriors-style games to date with kill counts ranging in the thousands for each battle. Repetition may set in early on, but by then you should be all ready to unleash your Noble Phantasm.",
"EA Sports makes some fun changes on the surface, but the more you play, the more you see all the same problems bubbling to the surface. I think this year's version is marginally better than Madden NFL 24, but not in any way that's going to matter to most fans. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to College Football 25.",
"If you've got a fondness for Hasbro's brand, High Moon Studios does not disappoint. If you played with a Transformer as a child and haven't revisited your inner 8-year-old in a few years, Fall of Cybertron will more than suffice. The latest title in the franchise won't disappoint and will provide plenty of childish, stupid fun, but it's not about to set the robotic world on fire.",
The graphics and sounds brings me back to the 90ies and Id Software's nice little hell. A nice place to spend a few hours. Doom II still rocks and is recommended to both old fans and new ones.,
"Gore, violence and blood have never been so beautiful like in this ""new"" 8-bit game. Hotline Miami is pure gameplay, addictive and thrilling like no other. With an incredibly intriguing storytelling and a stunning techno-electronic OST powered by Jasper Byrne, Dennaton's game shouldn't be missed for any reason.",
"Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania should include everything fans love about the series: Skill-based difficulty, great music, fun minigames, and excellent replayability with a good group of buddies by your side. Unfortunately, this collection feels like a rushed remake that throws out the precise controls and stellar music of the original titles. The charm and fun gameplay of the original games are still there, but this remake doesn’t feel like much of an improvement over the classics.",
"Spilled! is a short, cute little game with a fantastic message and a noble goal. Clocking in just under an hour of surprisingly fun yet simple gameplay, Spilled! will grant you a fun, relaxing afternoon and will donate a portion of your purchase to help protect the ocean’s wildlife.",
"Dr. Reuben’s inaugural experiment is no failure, and just like with all well performed experiments, Crush delivers a satisfactory result and serves to enlighten us on what the bright future holds.",
"If there is one thing Nintendo can be relied upon for delivering, it is the quality of track design and there is no disappointment within Mario Kart DD. Right from the start on Luigi Circuit, there is an air of simplicity and yet a multitude of hidden complexity, choice, racing line and shortcuts to choose from on the fly becomes evident over time.",
"A good game. A damn good game. For many it'll be a rent, but for fans of the character I would say there's enough incentive for a purchase, especially since there are some neat extras such as the ability to unlock classic comic book costumes for Wolverine to wear.",
"The added Super Duel Mode (which would also be good online) brings a new aspect to the title. Bottom line, despite its shortcomings, Mario Party 5 proves once again why the Nintendo Gamecube is the system to own for multiplayer fun.",
"Cities XL 2012 is more of an add-on for the 2011 edition. A nice little city builder game, easy to tackle at first, but with a very nice learning curve. But it's still very light compared to last year's edition, the new things are not that numerous, making it more of a die hard fan acquisition.",
"The wait was worth it: Ghost Story is a compelling, challenging, and joyously fun game whose craftsmanship shows itself at every turn. The meta-story of this game is that, like a lost civilization, we’re collectively unearthing something ancient, something forgotten, a story that could’ve been lost as so many others were in the early days of crowdfunding indie games. Given its ubiquity across current platforms, there are many options for the seasoned gamer to try out Ghost Song. I look forward to the weeks and months ahead, wherein players will no doubt begin theorizing about the game’s story. Like many in its subgenre, I also think this game will be an optimal space for the speedrunning community to flex their skills. I look forward to it, and hope that this isn’t the last we see of Ghost Song and the Deadsuit.",
"The latest game featuring Sonic is a mixed experience. It's the best Sonic-game since the 2D Sonic games and it's a fast, beautiful game with a lot of great levels that you can play many times over and over. But the controls can cause quite some problems and the multiplayer part isn't as good as it could have been.",
"Load times could be a bit shorter and I wouldn't mind seeing the price come down, but Lumines: Electronic Symphony is amazing. It's the simple puzzle game we've known for a while coupled with new mechanics like the shuffle block and the Vita's connectivity.",
"FFXIII-2 earns its score with aplomb, and I'd go so far to call it a sleeper hit. It's a genuinely great-playing game with an imperfect story, though to its credit, it eventually engages and justifies the wait. Its greatest battle now is escaping from the shadow and stigma of its big brother, but you should ignore the anti-hype, take a leap of faith and give it a chance.",
"If the difficulty curve were balanced a bit better, and the production values were higher -- meaning graphics, because the dialogue is awesome -- Raze's Hell would fare better in the score department.",
"A solid if not predictable shooter that manages to get the gimmick right. The included gun peripheral is a nice novelty and the shooting is actually quite enjoyable. The repetition will start to wear on you after a while but if you can look past that it should be a good time with the kids. If you love Nerf and are looking for a non-violent shooter to play with your kids I highly recommend checking out this quirky, but entertaining title.",
There’s a narrative that not only follows on from one of the finest stories ever written (and I'm not just talking in terms of video games) but succeeds in actually enhancing it. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible and does some amazing things in remixing music that was already peerless.,
"Soldier of Fortune: Payback has one thing going for it: excessive dismemberment. Everything else is standard stuff for a shooter. Yet, I must admit, that I get a guilty pleasure playing Payback. Though it's not a good game, it's still fun to see body parts fly.",
"Dead Island: Riptide is a game where enjoyment hinges entirely on personal satisfaction of repetitively killing thousands of zombies and having friends with the same passion. For these select people, Riptide can be a whole lot of fun; but for anybody going it solo or demanding more from a game than just mindless violence, however, it will prove increasingly tedious.",
"Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team isn't a game that will be remembered for a long time but as an advertisment it works great. It'a a fairly difficult game that encourages you to try out all 4 avaliable characters and play in co-op mode (but unfortunately only in local network). It's biggest flaws are: it's short and has some ridiculously placed checkpoints. Other than that it'a s pretty solid shooter, developed so we could impatiently wait for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 delivers on its promise to right past wrongs, even if only marginally. While it still cannot be said that the series is back to the quality the name Final Fantasy is synonymous with, it can be said that FFXIII-2 is a lot more fun than its predecessor, and definitely a step in the right direction. It may take another title or two, but Square definitely seems poised to re-claim the title of the world's best RPG developer.",
"Those who missed it the first time around or those who're looking for a strange, beautiful, and challenging throwback should certainly take a look at Guardian Heroes. It's prettier, smoother, and just as satisfying as ever",
"Foretales spearheads the card-based genre into an unexplored amalgamation of narration and choose-your-own-adventure though I wish it hadn't strayed from its card battler roots so much, which ultimately leads to a simple gameplay loop.",
"Quarrel is the prefect combination of Risk and Scrabble. You can pick it up whenever you want and still be able to kick some lexical buttocks. The only problem us Dutch gamers have, is that the game is only playable in English. A problem we're willing to overlook for mere 400 Microsoft Points.",
"There are so many unlockable characters, challenges, different difficulty setting, multi player modes, potential downloadable content, as well as downloadable user made maps, it would be hard to say there is little in way of replay value.",
"Majora’s Mask has aged with dignity. In fact it almost feels even better today, when Nintendo have failed to refresh the Zelda series for quite some time. The concept with the time pressure can be a bit stressful for newcomers, but after a while it really opens up and gives you both an interesting world and a well-written story.",
"Splatoon 2 is bursting at the seams with enjoyable ink-splattering fun both in its gameplay and presentation. With loads of ways to play and tons of rewarding goodies to discover, Splatoon 2 is clearly the next must-have Switch game.",
"Mixing action and racing can't really be considered something original, but it's always a good start if you know what you are doing. Fuel Overdose is not that innovative, and it won't get us hooked, but it can give us some fun moments due to its varied and crazy courses.",
"With around fifteen hours of gameplay that keep you compelled to play until the end in combination with a storyline that continues to surprise, Ghost Trick may be crammed full of tricks but is most definitely an absolute treat.",
"Even though it borrows a lot from other driving games, Ridge Racer: Unbounded still manages to find its own identity with fast-paced racing in high-octane environments. It may not feel like a Ridge Racer game at all, but who cares when the racing is this well-crafted?",
"Journey of a Roach is an excellent adventure game by creators that put interesting logical puzzles and good humour fully into the game. Unfortunately, you will have to get used to its camera rotation.",
"Unfortunately, the end result is a game that falls somewhere in between the two extremes, and will likely satisfy neither the main-stream gamer they were trying to court, nor the hardcore strategy fan they had in their back-pocket.",
"While this latest effort has its share of missteps, it's still the best Madden in recent memory. Gameplay is king, and Madden NFL 10 is plain and simple a hell of a lot of fun to play. This is a must-have for football fans.",
"Gone is the non-linear design of each mission. Each objective is now clearly marked one after another, eliminating secondary (optional) objectives and different ways of approaching a target, which were key and exciting components in the original Ghost Recon game.",
"To sum up things, I didn't care for Mahjong Cub3D. I'm all for interesting ways to play established games, and while the developers were clearly trying to change up the formula, I don't feel like it worked.",
"Evotinction is a solid first-effort from this developer. The bones are there for a fantastic follow-up. For this adventure though it is worth knowing what you are getting into before diving in. If you enjoy tense stealth adventures, this could be for you. If you are looking for even a remote amount of action, best to look elsewhere. As it stands this curiously titled game is a solid, if lacking adventure that definitely has my eye on Spikewave Games.",
"Neople blew us away, demonstrating an unexpected level of experience and awareness in the soulslike genre. The First Berserker: Khazan is, despite some flaws, an extraordinarily competent soulslike, built for veteran players who want a serious challenge. Sure, there is still room for improvement, it's not very original, and there were some excessive choices here and there... Still, this is a great ""first try""and deserves recognition.",
"The most important thing to do before setting out to play Earth 2150 is to remember to synchronize your watch, because it does not count to be slow in this game, or things will burn up.",
"The best has to be Ash's undead sidekick Sam (never mind Crispin and Jon D.), since he serves to break up the monotony of the combat (you use him to solve puzzles) and gives Bruce Campbell someone to play off of for one-liners.",
Falls victim to the same problems the Kinect's worst games suffered from a year ago. Imprecise controls ruin the uncomplicated games. It started out unfulfilling and didn't get much better. It's the kind of mindless thing I'd load up on my phone for five minute bursts. At home I'd rather be doing anything else.,
Blast from the past when real-time strategies used to dominate the world. The creators took the concept of the first part almost completely and besides the updated visuals there is no extra value added to differentiate the sequel from the original.,
"From the get-go, Miami’s presentation has a unique style, with vivid colors, generous amounts of post-process filtering and a stunning soundtrack (you will just let the game play on, only to hear the tracks). But at the same time, all notions of continuous fast-paced action gameplay disappear. Hotline Miami is essentially a top-down stealth game, that rewards the player with imaginative (and quite violent) kill animations. [January 2013]",
"AiRace Xeno doesn't do anything we haven't seen before, but it's a finely-crafted time-attack racer that's well worth the low price for fans of sci-fi racing, with luscious visuals and a bumpin' soundtrack.",
"It&#146;s a good looking game &#150; without being stunning &#150; it handles well and offers a refreshing alternative to the usual racing fare. Some of the races do get frustrating, but on the whole, Midnight Club II is an enjoyable experience &#150; particularly in multiplayer mode.",
"If you come into Enchanted Arms looking for something as epic as the Final Fantasy series then there’s a hefty chance you’ll leave disappointed. That’s not to say this is a bad game at all. Enchanted Arms plays like most would expect - an average RPG. Nothing more, nothing less.",
"The positive and negative sides of the curious Piku Odyssey end up being absurd: the first work of the collective Sectordub entertains and distracts, without leaving a mark beyond the carefree and cheerful tones.",
"Loads of mini-games, split-screen co-op play throughout the entire story mode and online game play, including deathmatches and a fiesty soccer skirmish, flesh out this budget-priced title.",
Metro: Last Light is proudly steeped in the best traditions of other storied FPS giants while still evoking the kind of philosophical underpinnings from the Metal Gear Solid and BioShock series.,
"While Riptide banks on you having loved the first, in actuality you have a lot more to gain if you've never touched it...If you played the first game, however, I'd recommend waiting for a real sequel, because Riptide fails to get away with pulling the same trick twice.",
"Mini Motorways is a fun little puzzler-builder with beautiful minimalist visuals. Coupled with a charming presentation, this game is a perfect way to relax after a stressful day, but also provides a hefty amount of challenges along the way.",
"Milestone brings back the real MotoGP experience, unfortunately with many technical issues (graphics engine limps and suffers in the most hectic situations). Once again, it's a starting point to create, someday, the perfect hybrid between MotoGP 08 and GP500, but it's not the game that many fans have been waiting from Milestone.",
"Having this much Taken-slaughtering glee in such a small, concise package makes Alan Wake's American Nightmare an instant ""yes, please"" for series fans. But what's more surprising is that its accessible approach to combat makes it an equally worthwhile experience for those who've never suspended their disbelief to wander Wake's dream-like world. [Mar 2012, p.62]",
"As part of a much larger story though, Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition delivers finesse in all the right places. A truly polished port, despite its handheld visuals, offering RPG fans a delightful 80+ hour adventure (90+ including Future Connected) and a taste of the Monado’s true power. As always, Xenoblade Chronicles remains one of the most tight-knit storylines of the franchise – and we can’t afford to lose our heads sight of that.",
"It could be said that MotoGP 13 feels like a cheap downloadable game wrapped in the glittery shell of licensing to sell as AAA, which is all too often the case in gaming, and in some ways this is accurate. However the extreme attention to detail and the strangely paced yet enjoyable career mode up this game above some of the more pedestrian licensed games in the world. It is a game clearly made for motorcycle enthusiasts and for these people it just about does the job.",
"A game that really tries to be like the LEGO games but with Marvel characters, but doesn't succeed entirely. Playing on your own is rather boring, but the co-op mode improves the experience immensely, even if the game is a bit short. Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Guantlet is a far cry from games like LEGO Indiana Jones or LEGO Harry Potter, but there's still fun to be had here. Worth picking up on a bargain.",
"Time Crisis: Razing Storm combines a bad story with even worse controls. This game is not worth your money, despite the fact that the two extra games are even more fun than Razing Storm itself.",
Kill Team is an absolute blast to play. It's a no-frills action shooter from start to finish with a focus on purely destroying everything in sight. It's just too bad that they decided to leave out online coop because that could have made a good game great.,
"Anyone who already owns either Dead or Alive 5 or Dead or Alive 5 Plus already knows a lot of this stuff, so why am I repeating it? Because it's probably only worth buying if you don't already own it in one form or another, unless you absolutely must have the few additional characters or environments. However, if you don't already own Dead or Alive 5, this is certainly the best version of the game.",
"An idea that does not overstay its welcome, enhanced by a great narrative and truly remarkable art direction. Be on the lookout for future publications by Cavalier Games and Tequila Works.",
"Like most PSP games, Moto GP is pretty much the same as the Playstation 2 version, just smaller. While the translation is very well done, there’s nothing interesting and worthwhile unless you really need it in a portable format.",
"Niggling flaws aside, Vermintide is easily one of the most surprising games to launch this year. Although there’s a clear lack of originality, Fatshark has done a brilliant job in throwing together a patchwork of borrowed designs with its own previous work on games like War of the Roses. It’s got the makings of a sleeper hit and hopefully, with a few more refinements, can grow into the next multiplayer must-have.",
"Although slower-paced than the likes of After Burner, and less flashy at first glance, 3D Thunder Blade offers a more varied selection of environments and more visual details making the setting of the game more visually appealing, if not by the sensations it provides.",
"As rich, inspiring and epic as strategy games get, and (save for Blizzard's ""Warcraft III"") it's possibly the most immersive strategy game we have seen in quite some time... [Yet]the AI could've been better.",
"Fuzion Frenzy 2 is like a decent-tasting smoothie of low-calorie gaming activities with a disgusting cherry on top. The game improves a lot if you’re playing at home with friends or smack-talking strangers online, but like any party, it isn’t meant to be a solo affair.",
"Compulsion Games has crafted a love letter to Southern Gothic with its third-person action-adventure game South of Midnight. The characters feel larger-than-life and intimately relatable all at once, while the narrative doesn't shy away from the brutal nature of the South's history. Combat is fun, though limited enemy variety does drag toward the end of the game. Overall, it's a story that feels intimate and uncomfortable, and one I hope others experience.",
"Rubik’s World is a well made game for the most part, it just lacks a bit of consistency across its games, and is ultimately a title that will get lost in the sea of licensed products.",
"But frankly, this type of fun we've all seen for the PSX twice already, and there's not really enough here to warrant dropping the dough and adding it to the collection - so rent before you buy.",
"This game can definitely hang with the best of them, though, which may come as a big surprise to those who thought that Mortal Kombat was dead. MK:DA has enough for both old MK fans and more ""modern"" fighting game players to keep most everyone entertained for quite a while.",
"Overall the mission design is boring and repetitive, the graphics are so-so, the online is blah, the customization is awesome, and the overall experience isn’t worth the price of admission. Pass. [JPN Import]",
"Fate/Extella is a title that has a lot to live up to due to the immense popularity of the Fate series as a whole. However, it doesn’t do much to stray from the typical formula set forth by the countless other musou titles on the market. It sports a serviceable but unremarkable combat engine, along with a story that felt just as disposable as one of the tens of thousands of enemies I left in my wake.",
"We had some great expectations for this title, but sadly Legrand Legacy wasn't quite able to live up to them. We strongly suggest to download the free demo on Steam before buying this title, to see for yourself what you're going into.",
"Ronin has little plot to speak of, but is focused like it’s own motorcycle helmeted avenger on a tight and tactical turn-ish-based combat mechanic. Looks a little like Gunpoint. Plays like Ronin.",
"Strategy aficionados will look on approvingly as fans of the series rejoice. It’s certainly not a game for everyone, yet those who find themselves hooked by Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII will struggle to break free of its hold. The fact that it plays so well on console as well as on PC shows that Koei is capable of more than mindless button bashers.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is, without a doubt, the best way to experience Shulk’s story and manages to earn a place as a standout title in the Switch’s overall library.",
"It's easy to fall in love with Monochroma's style, but the stiff and slow responsiveness of the controls and the annoying brother on your back, makes it a tough challenge to complete the game.",
"It's fun and lighthearted and sure to make fans smile, but Dancing All Night isn't anything special; it's just an average rhythm game that's begging for a better interface and more song variety.",
"Sports Bar VR is fun for the price. It's super cheap and most of the games work ok. The biggest annoyances come from moving around the bar, and re-positioning yourself to better play the game.",
"The game's actual gameplay just isn't exciting. You'll find the typical, simple grapple system alongside a number of jabs and kicks and takedowns in the game but they are all rather repetitive.",
"The car handling is rather touchy and the car physics are a bit too floaty and unbalanced, and therefore turning and jumping on the game’s narrow tracks at high speeds, especially the later, more difficult ones, can get too challenging and frustrating for its own good.",
"I wasn’t impressed much by the game’s visuals. They don’t seem to offer much beyond any other game, unless you like drab pre-rendered backgrounds and some remarkably not-stunning character designs.",
"All in all, Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time features intriguing characters, a solid story, tons of dialogue and simplistic RPG mechanics. It was definitely made for a younger audience in mind, and at times seems to forget that the younger audience can take on a challenge. Much like its main character Akko, it is going to be great someday, but right now just needs a bit more balance and work.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a blast for veterans and newcomers, featuring plenty of appealing content, though I was slightly split on multiplayer. But with so much sheer monkey madness and unbridled fun, I’m very glad SEGA didn’t drop the ball.",
"Gamers looking for twitch action or a strategy game with a strong emphasis on combat might be disappointed, but gamers who prefer to meticulously oversee things rather than execute them directly have something to look forward to.",
"After three entries, the series felt like it needed some serious polish and some new ideas, and the passage on a new hardware seemed to be the perfect occasion: instead, this is just another Mario & Sonic game with a couple of new modes and the same old ups and downs.",
Strong storytelling and sheer novelty make guiding Heinrich and his pals around the dark forests of old-time Deutschland enthralling...even if you do miss the magic missiles and elves every so often.,
"Commando: Origins was meant to revive the franchise after years of silence, but it falls short. There is no cohesive story and the missions feel quite random. However, the missions are varied and the commandos offer different strategies. Don’t expect a lot of freedom or creativity. Despite detailed gameplay mechanics, numerous bugs severely impact the experience, often forcing players to reload saves. With optimization issues also present, it's best to wait for a few patches before diving in to enjoy the nostalgic gameplay.",
"Beautifully different action game. It's not perfect and there are some things that could be improved, but you will find original elements and interesting moments that are worth it. It's a shame that the various distractions make the game less enjoyable and can be frustrating. However, if you want an unusual combat and action experience, you will definitely get it here.",
"Namco Museum for Switch is about what you’d expect if you’ve played any of the other packages that the company has put together over the last quarter of a century. What’s here is decent, but there just isn’t enough of it.",
"The biggest problem in need of improvement would have to be in the soundtrack. Don’t get me wrong, the music is well composed and fitting for the game, but too often in the mission you get this repeat atmospheric type music that is about a five-second long (if that) affair that then repeats itself in total constancy.",
"How these french bakers succeeded to create a good mix between an epic story, billiards, squids and rpg games, it's still a mystery. Anyway, they did it. This is one of the best indie games on Wii U e-shop.",
"World of Final Fantasy Maxima acts as a wonderful celebration of the Final Fantasy series that will surely appeal to fans both new and old. Though the difficulty is a little on the easy side, the story is uninspired and the visuals are disappointingly blurry, the Mirage-catching mechanics and well-crafted RPG systems make this one a good recommendation. If you loved the Final Fantasy games of days past, you’re sure to love this one, and if you’re new to the series or the JRPG genre in better, this is a great place to jump in; just don't expect anything too demanding.",
"Wattam is a pure, adorable joy. Keita Takahashi's signature idiosyncrasies shine through in this playful game about friendship and finding pleasure in the simple things. Interacting with the wacky cast of characters is great fun, and there's almost no pressure to march on with the story if you'd rather do your own thing. It's a shame the technical side of things lets the experience down somewhat, but when the game is at its ludicrous best, you probably won't care.",
"Similar to Dinosaur Polo Club’s previous game Mini Metro, not only the game mechanics but also the visuals and sound contribute in making Mini Motorways a fun and polished game. Its game design allows players to enjoy the essence of a city-builder by simply laying roads, and the game offers interesting tactical challenges depending on your skill.",
"It is in the thrill of space combat that Manticore: Galaxy on Fire comes alive, as you get an enemy in your sights and mercilessly hunt them down. It’s not without its imperfections, but genre fans will get more than enough from the spectacle of it all.",
"The experience in Madden NFL 25 is exactly what you'd expect: consistent gameplay, a presentation that mirrors real life, and game modes that allow football fans to fully enjoy the sport. However, comparisons with College Football are inevitable.",
"An excellent downhill bike racing game that gives you an amazing sense of speed, anxiousness, great control over your character and changing weather as you go from the top of the mountain to the bottom.",
"Phantasy Reverie Series is a relatively no-frills remaster collection. There's a couple of quality of life improvements and the games have a fresh lick of high definition paint, but if you didn't like Klonoa back in the day then you're not going to like it now. If you didn't play Klonoa at the time then you won't have the prerequisite nostalgia goggles necessary to gaze upon these games and see them for anything more than what they are — a couple of pretty good platformers and little else, and that's fine.",
There's no doubt that NCAA Football 06 lives up to the pre-release hype and keeps the dynasty going by staying on top and garnering yet another title as the best college football game around.,
"Dicefolk is a fun turn-based roguelike with a decent variety of environments and characters to stay entertaining, but the content itself becomes repetitive. Although excitement is added through boss encounters and the gamble of random rolls, the repetition holds Dicefolk back from excelling.",
"While some unique gimmicks and solid gameplay have made other god games fun to play, these elements are curiously absent from Heaven & Hell, leaving it a short, and otherwise dull, experience.",
"I found very little not to like about Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, which is superior to its predecessor in every way. It still felt a bit short, but it looks better, it plays better and it even feels better.",
From the start you can tell the puzzles are going to be good but even that will start to wear thin when you have to battle the same monsters time and time again whilst moving from room to room.,
"A good-looking college football title that, despite being high on gameplay modes and playbook strategies, isn't quite as fine tuned to the sport it portrays as ""NCAA Football 2003"".",
"While Dead Island: Riptide serves the zombie genre well, it doesn’t do anything new with it. You’ve killed a million enemies like this before, and the only real differences this time around are aesthetic. The developers at Techland are adamant that Riptide is more of a spin-off than a true sequel, so maybe next time they’ll find some brains for this undead series.",
"Fallen Legion has a wealth of great ideas, but ultimately crumbles under its ambitions. A fun combat system helps form a strong core, but one that ultimately doesn’t hold together for very long. The saving grace here is the beautiful artwork and smooth animations, which are complimented by some great music. Unfortunately, it’s hard to recommend the game on those traits alone; Fallen Legion is interesting, and promising, but rarely enjoyable.",
"It's hard to quantify whether The Silver Case 2425 is a good game. Certainly, we didn't enjoy it in the slightest. But it's extremely purposeful with its Suda51-ness — his work might be an acquired taste, but for those who've already acquired it, this may well fill in the gaps in his back catalogue that you've been waiting for. In the case of anyone new to Suda's work, this visual novel is just too hard to recommend.",
"If you like to solve interactive puzzles and can appreciate depth over flashy cosmetics, then you will get a lot out of this game. It's an adventure ... with a more human character than .... well, Lara Croft. Al is just ... Al. Balding, nerdy and all.",
"It's unbelievable, but Playground games has surpassed the already brilliant Forza Horizon 4 in every way and sets a new standard for the fun you can have in a racing game. Forza Horizon 5 is a must-have, even as a racing novice, and the perfect excuse to get an Xbox Series X. Viva la Mexico!",
"Has some great features on paper, but when played out, it underperforms and seems to be more gimmick than fun. The game excels as a multiplayer football game online or with a friend. As a simulation or for a stat gamer, the game fails miserably.",
"All things considered, though, I would heartily recommend Close to the Sun. With some fantastic world-building, an incredibly well detailed and atmospheric setting that's enhanced by a cast of interesting characters with great voice acting. The real issue comes from the lack of replay value, though for those who like to explore the world and story, there are reasons to go back.",
"A superior game to its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the game that probably should have been originally released. Even if it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to do.",
"There's still an argument for considering other mini-game collections with better ratios of good-to-poor games. The ratio in Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 isn't even as good as it was in the first game. And overall the game isn't as entertaining as a rabbit doing a poo on a stage, which should tell you something.",
"Nintendo Switch players that opt to revive a classic such as Onimusha: Warlords HD Remaster will find everything that made Capcom special in a title that feels like a Resident Evil spin-off. However, I must remind everyone that the game doesn't go beyond a simple port.",
"I loved the nostalgic feel of the game, and how detailed the world was, with the ability to capture everything with the camcorder. However, a lot of the conversations felt too drawn out, with a lot of awkward pauses, or overlapping conversation that just felt too overwhelming.",
"A Kinect party game with good motion sensing as its strength – hard to believe, but Rabbids Alive & Kicking feels that way. The graphic are a mixed bag, the sound feels a bit weak, but you'll generally understand why you didn't manage to really whack that Rabbid. If dancing isn't your thing and Dance Central 2 is out, likely the best party game for Kinect – if you can find the right minigames for your crowd.",
"Beyond Eyes is an breathtaking accomplishment. It's a game that not only entertains, but that also gets across some of the difficulties that a differently abled person would need to contend with, in a way that is entirely understandable by everyone.",
"The season does end on a strong note, with plenty of bloodshed, and a special mystery with what Gared finds in the North past the wall. It's too bad that the some of the season's highest points are little more than a setup for the next season. I admit that there were a few intense situations, like poking a guy's eye out, but they are overshadowed by the fact that my choices generally didn't much matter in a game with the primary focus on decision making--underscored by how the same one eyed-man still talked crap to the cripple that beat him up.",
"It not only becomes increasingly repetitive as it nears the climax but also puts a significant strain on players' patience as Nihilistic injects enemies with a higher HP and more powerful weapons, rather than finding a more engaging way to challenge players. It's a jarring difficulty spike that almost undermines everything the game has so far accomplished as it impressively leaps from one set-piece to the next.",
"Overall, if you are the type of gamer that enjoys tough puzzle games then The Magic Obelisk will impress with its unique concept and wonderful presentation. For everyone else, the difficulty and control issues may be too much.",
"An enjoyable and entertaining game that proves Square Enix is not down and out. However, it puts fans of the series in an awkward position, intriguing us enough to play through the game but constantly reminding us of its inadequacies.",
"Improved on the field, with a gameplay that shows signs of an evolution that affects animations, attack and defense, Madden NFL 25 misses the mark when it comes to the game modes offered. Too few differences compared to last season, for an element that instead needs new proposals capable of bringing a burst of innovation that has been missing for too long now.",
"Kingdom Hearts 2.8 is a must play for any Kingdom Hearts fan, just for KH 0.2 alone. Not only is there a wonderful remaster of an underrated 3DS game, but players get their first opportunity to go hands-on with the gameplay for Kingdom Hearts 3. While I found Kingdom Hearts X: Back Cover to be a bit of a shoo-in, it does give fans of both the mobile game and the series some extra content to enjoy. With Kingdom Hearts 3 a while off, Kingdom Hearts 2.8 is the perfect appetizer.",
"Its gameplay mechanics are at best, boring, and at worst, snooze-worthy. If you enjoy Neopets, you may want to give this one a tentative rent, but that’s the most that I can suggest to anyone.",
"Is MLB 2K6 close to perfect? No. It’s far from it. Beneath the little kinks, however, there is a solid, fun baseball game to be played and, in the end, isn’t that what we all want?",
Super Princess Peach will be enjoyed most by those gamers who tackled Nintendo's platformers in the pre-64 days. There’s a lot to collect and for once you get to save Mario. [JPN Import],
"Were spirits to play a game while they waited in Purgatory, surely it would be Mario Party. It can take an age to get to the end, and the minigames are interspersed with a turgid board game section that tests the patience to its limits. [Jan 2004, p.109]",
"Lego City Undercover isn't ceaselessly brilliant - open-world games seldom are - but it's a fantastic example of what makes Traveller's Tales and TT Fusion such special developers, and the worst I can say is that it's occasionally only fun. And you know what? I'll take that wherever I can find it.",
"As suggested by its tagline, ‘made by freaks for freaks’, this game might not win you over if you are not already interested in speedrunning, puzzle-shooters and/or anime-inspired visual novels but, if you even slightly happen to be, Neon White is a bona-fide cult classic with a genre combination made in heaven.",
"Jagged Alliance: Rage is a fun game when judged on its own merits. It’s certainly not a proper sequel, and perhaps that would be a bit too much to expect from a game that’s selling for a mere 20 bucks. It does have a few whiffs of what made Jagged Alliance great though, and if this would have been sold as a way to whet our appetites for a full sequel coming out next year, I think it would have landed much better with the fans than it did. As it stands, Jagged Alliance: Rage is a cute distraction, a fun-for-a-while-not-quite-Jagged-Alliance that will polarize fans more than it had intended, but should not be dismissed right out of hand.",
"Your enjoyment of Filthy Lucre will entirely depend on how much you enjoy pure stealth – sneaking around half an hour into a mission as the music ramps up due to increased heat can be incredibly tense – but some people may just dislike having to start all over if you die. The shooting is bad, the AI isn’t great – and why, oh why can’t I move dead bodies? – but Filthy Lucre still succeeds in being a tense, and most importantly, fun stealth game.",
"Wuppo is a fun game with a lot of heart, made all the more enjoyable by the clearly evident fact that it has been meticulously and lovingly created. Wuppo is a game with character; it knows exactly what it wants to be and what it wants to do, and it accomplishes those tasks elegantly and creatively.",
"The character himself simply feels more at home in this shorter, punchier, less laboured and self-regarding form. Freed from the weight of expectation that accompanies a full retail release in this genre, the experience - while lacking the set-piece spectacle and spookiness of the original - is less forced and more comfortably pitched.",
"Unquestionably, Ghost Recon 2 is a more well-rounded and intense experience than before, but despite some beautiful locations and powerful sound effects it still errs on the side of cold simulation rather than an emotional and dramatic war experience. But that's exactly what some people want. [Christmas 2004, p.83]",
"The fundamental multiplayer features and huge single-player challenges will keep you busy whether you're with friends or alone, the presentation is greatly improved, and the set list amazes us, with songs scattered between the 60's and today.",
"For me, South of Midnight is a bit of a triumph, and exactly the sort of thing I want to see more of from Xbox Game Studios. It's not perfect, and its combat mechanics are a bit lacking, but the game has so much soul, personality and charm that it's hard not to fall in love with it. I was engrossed with the storybook visuals, the well-delivered narrative and the satisfying traversal from start to finish, and I really can't recommend this one enough on Xbox Game Pass. Those of you that are more combat-first may not take a shining to this game quite as much as I have, but if you're looking for an engaging adventure that delivers soulful stories in spades, South of Midnight shouldn't be missed.",
"Killer Is Dead successfully separates itself from the pack, but it doesn’t live up to all its potential. It ends too soon, is padded with reused areas, and suffers from tech problems that should be defunct.",
"For all its inconsistencies, complexities, inadequacies and oddities, The Last Story offers an entrancing and seamless flow of interesting experiences. And surely that, in the final reckoning, is what counts.",
"While it makes an excellent party game, I’m not sure that I see Crimsonland having much longevity beyond that. It will definitely come out from time to time when I want to coordinate with friends or family to kill all the things, but it’s not particularly memorable as more than a retro action shooter brought back to life on PS4.",
"Perseverance is another possible name for this game, since the flow of the story is somewhat sporadic, but it's rewarding to do so. It still has a strong Final Fantasy feel, albeit not as strong, and some of the great changes are contradicted by odd or particular ones.",
"Needless to say, I played this entire game tense, angry, and praying that the next level would be the last. I never really felt like I was in control at any point during the game. The summer movie games usually bring misery, but I never expected them to bring this much pain.",
"Insecticide warrants some praise for its offbeat theme and oddball characters, but there's not enough game here to recommend. All 18 levels are short, combat is clunky, and there's only one game mode.",
"This installment is a lot closer to modern Civilization games than to classic Age of Wonders. The differences between factions are so few and far between, everyone might as well be humans under various banners. [Issue#262, p.72]",
"Overall Röki is a thoroughly modern take on the Point and Click genre, adding the ability to highlight intractable objects really gives anyone the ability to play and enjoy this game.",
"If you hated its predecessor you will surely not warm up to this sequel. On the other hand Serah and Noel do a lot better than Lightning and her friends in Final Fantasy XIII. Here's more to do, more to discover, more roleplaying.",
"A very satisfying sequel, vast and blessed by a great level design, both gameplay and art-wise. Only a slightly disappointing story and some camera problems keep it from reaching higher heights.",
"The addition of online multiplayer makes this the most complete entry in the franchise, yet. Being one of the few fighting games to strike a perfect blend of accessibility and depth, DOAU almost guarantees that players of all skill levels will get plenty of enjoyment out of it.",
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a great entry for newcomers, plus the story mode and multiplayer expand upon the gameplay in fun, if inconsequential ways. Puzzle Bobble vs Space Invaders is a great new addition, but it also leaves me wanting for an entry in this franchise that truly brings in some new ideas.",
"One of the fastest, most insane combat-racing games ever devised... If the tracks were a little bit less ambitious or the trick system streamlined for human hands, DD would easily be one of the best games of its type. [Aug 2003, p.78]",
"SEGA fans, run don't walk to the shops, but be prepared to give Superstars a few hours before the gameplay starts hugging you as hard as the graphics and sound. Everyone else, dust off Virtua Tennis 3 for a more complete alternative.",
"Wins with simplicity. Strategically challenging without losing pace. Lack of variation and a bit to stupid AI brings down the grade, but it's still one of the more charming games I have played in a long time.",
"Time Crisis: Razing Storm does a splendid job of being a bit of throwaway fluff you might be able to pick up on the cheap a couple of months from now, but anyone expecting something more than yet another tired throwback will be sorely disappointed.",
"Similar to a race car in its design. It was made to do a job and do it better than anything else out there. There's no waste, yet the technology has been used to its fullest in order to squeeze maximum performance out of the hardware.",
"The controls can be a little wonky and it's devoid of features or customisation, but for 500 Points you're getting an interesting and full puzzle experience (over 30 chapters all told) that's worth checking out.",
"A fascinating new narrative adventure from the original Life is Strange team, this first slice boasts fresh twists that help move the formula forward, even if its story sometimes feels a remix of genre tropes.",
"If its aesthetics appeal and the gameplay style grabs you, then Loop Hero will take over your gaming life until you finish it or are drag yourself away. It reminded me strangely of the allure of Football Manager but with a more fantasy setting. The combination of auto combat and strategic choices, with resource management and settlement development on top, makes this a unique and captivating indie game.",
"A true sequel or a glorified ""more of the same"". Oddly, both. There's no real revolution in Splatoon 2, just some small improvements here and there. A game that's so rich, deep and full of content, and it's only bound to grow in the upcoming months. Blessed by a solid net code, a stylish art direction, and great personality, Splatoon is sheer fun.",
"For fans of turn-based strategy games, the paranormal, or even just Westerns, I have a hard time imagining a reason to not pick up Hard West II. Nearly everything that Hard West II attempts to do is accomplished very well. It offers fantastic and challenging combat, fun characters, an amazing setting, and some truly jaw-dropping moments.",
"LEGO City is a great game - but I do wonder just how many limitations the hardware had on the final product. Perhaps it has nothing to do with the Wii U, but for Traveller's Tales to omit multiplayer altogether? That seems an unlikely choice, considering their previous work.",
"Super Princess Peach is cute, delightfully absurd, and a true-blue Mario game, but still a bit easy. It's probably worth fifty clams to a hardcore Mario fan, but maybe a bit iffy for someone looking for a challenge. [JPN Import]",
"We're not too much passionate about Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Charter Prologue, at least not at full price. Dream Drop Distance is a really fun game, but if you already own it on 3DS, this new edition doesn't offer too much else. A Fragmentary Passage is a real blast, but it's over in a jiff. Could be worthwhile for hardcore fans of the saga, especially if on sale.",
"Reality Fighters is a well-polished offering with much to offer in terms of novelty value, social features and unique character creation options. Unfortunately, its core gameplay is unlikely to hook fighting fans or those looking for anything beyond a few casual kicks.",
"Cities XL 2012 is even less of a complete title than its predecessor was. When the removal of a core gameplay feature isn't replaced with an effective replacement, what you're left with is a broken game. No effort has been taken to bring C:XL to ""2012"" standards in the way of a graphics overhaul, and it still runs like a dog with 3 legs to boot.",
"Foretales manages to be both innovative in its gameplay and deliver an engaging story, a rare combination in the world of card-driven video games. It’s fast-paced, asks players to think about actions and consequences, and deals with the fate of the world and with more personal relationships. The combination of systems might be a little overwhelming initially, but it only takes about an hour before the game reveals its depth and variety. The developers at Alkemi have created a deep game that encourages players to think outside the box and minimize casualties as much as possible. Foretales will reward players for giving it their time and energy.",
"Hunt the Night requires a lot of skill and a lot of patience, but becomes more enjoyable once you learn how everything works. Everything looks, sounds, and controls great, and you’ll definitely begin to feel the challenge even in the opening areas of the game. Between the interesting puzzles and multiple ways to customize your loadout for dealing with enemies, Hunt the Night is an enjoyable game, though frustrating at times. If you’re up for a challenge, Hunt the Night will definitely put your skills to the test.",
"Some may prefer the accessible Master of Orion, some may want the complexity and diversity of Stellaris. Bur for now Endless Space 2 is my first choice: challenging, suspenseful and sufficiently versatile, but still accessible enough, so I don’t tumble into one failure after another.",
"Domination suddenly becomes quite spectacularly addictive. It's not doing anything special, but it releases just the right amount of adrenaline to get you truly hooked. [Aug 2003, p.97]",
"South of Midnight delivers one of the most interesting and visually stunning settings in recent memory. It feels like a tribute to the Deep South; it shows reverence to actual folklore while adding its own interesting twists that interweave with Hazel’s family history and the story Compulsion Games wanted to tell. Its traversal and combat don’t offer anything we haven’t seen before, but it’s a well-made experience, with its biggest crime being overly familiar systems. What it lacks in gameplay innovation, it more than makes up for with its quirky storytelling and style; ultimately, South of Midnight offers a distinct and gripping point of view that’s hard not to fall in love with.",
Thinking gamers will appreciate the fact that Theatre of War presents them with a series of tactical problems rather than simply a chance to rack up the body counts. And anyone who's been jaded by the ease of other mainstream RTS franchises will enjoy the fact that this is a game that doesn't coddle its players.,
"The First Berserker: Khazan is yet another great action RPG that, although it uses concepts from the soulslike formula, is still able to deliver intense and satisfying combat to make it unique. Some decisions in the art direction make its visuals a little repetitive in the final stretch of the campaign, but overall it is a game easily recommended for fans of the genre.",
"After its stormy development, FF12 isn't just a worthy installment of the series, but a great RPG in its own right, one that thinks differently and feels all the better for it. [JPN Import; June 2006, p.72] Stunning Design. [Feb 2007, p.66]",
"Forza's handling is impeccable. Many car sims have done an adequate job of providing an impression of the forces exerted on a car as it hurtles around a track, but in Forza it's as though you can feel the exact point where your tires lose traction.",
"Had the missions were more expansive, and the multiplayer broader, this would have been a must-buy—especially on the PS3. As it is, Armored Core 4 is the best in the series, and a decent action game.",
"Like a friend that refuses to grow up, Need for Speed: Unbound brings the franchise back with all of its inherent silliness and ill-advised driving. And, just like that friend, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Its story is forgettable, and its characters are more than a little irritating, but it’s a solid arcade racer that hopefully acts as a springboard for the franchise.",
"Though the game's pulled off really well in the Famicom Mini version, the game has already been available twice on the GBA...so the air's been let out of the tires just a bit. It's still a worthy and amazingly fun addition to the classic collection.",
"It’s got all the hallmarks of a successful JRPG, but dressing it up in beautiful hand-drawn maps and a stunning soundtrack hasn’t gone far enough in helping to conceal its flaws. It’s a shame, because the bones of a great game are there. They’re just too bogged down in a shaky delivery to be enjoyed in the manner that they deserve.",
"It's imaginative, it controls well, and the puzzles are solid and challenging without being repetitive. It's simply that a basic weakness in the engine makes The Haunted Mansion a far more frustrating experience than it really needs to be.",
"Majora's Mask 3D feels at home among today's indie games, but it also serves as a reminder that there used to be room for the offbeat at all levels of the games industry. And with the tweaks and improvements this version enjoys over the original release, it remains quite playable despite its age.",
"If, like a zombie on Banoi, you've been absolutely starved for fresh meat, then Riptide might be for you. In my case, it left me with a familiar heartburn and a bad taste in my gullet.",
"Sports Bar VR needs a couple of important patches and some polishing here and there, but what it already offers is unique; even unforgettable, if you are lucky enough to find the right company in its virtual environment.",
"A very sweet game and, thankfully, very easy to play from the outset. While nowhere near as comprehensive as ""The Sims,"" this is as endearing and sylish as keeping people as pets gets.",
"Ever Forward is a very beautiful and captivating game with a warm and touching story about the relationship between mother and daughter. Sadly, it's too short, and not without problems.",
"Michonne is terrible in her protagonist role – she is unsociable, cynical and silent. But she is the most mysterious and unusual character from the The Walking Dead. To squeeze player into her skin is a very convenient way to show how she came to such a life. [Issue#210, p.77]",
"It seems a little silly to gush about a video game that simulates housework but given the added amount of stress and anxiety that has crept into my life lately, House Flipper is a wonderful way to shut out the noise of the world for a little bit.",
"A standing ovation goes to Gaijin Games who have the courage and talent to change the basic premise in every Bit Trip title they make, and to do that well. Bit Trip Void is fun, challenging and packed with retro goodies. It's also a bargain.",
"Don’t be fooled by comparisons to Super Paper Mario – Crush is its own unique animal, and a puzzle game through-and-through. However, if that’s what you’re looking for, Crush delivers with a fresh concept, a solid presentation and some truly enjoyable dimension-twisting puzzles.",
"One of the most refreshing games I've played all winter. I didn't say it was the best, but if you're getting a little bored of dungeon crawling, shooting and fighting, then consider Everblue 2 as your winter vacation.",
"If you like your survival horror experience to have more combat and co-op play, Revelations 2 is a great pick. Played solo, it's not nearly as fun, but regardless it offers a good story, interesting characters, and a good amount of content for the price.",
"Concord gets the fundamentals right: unique characters, strong art direction and tightly designed combat make for thrilling matches with Crew Bonuses adding a welcome extra level of strategy. Uninteresting progression, unrealised storytelling potential and a lack of personality hold it back, but a commitment to the content roadmap and worldbuilding could salvage things. I am hopeful Firewalk Studios can turn things around given the chance.",
"As the last Final Fantasy of the current-gen, it delivers as the best of the bunch. An epic story, incredible characters, slightly-innovated battle system and some of the best graphics seen on the PS2 add up for an incredible journey any RPG fan shouldn't miss out on.",
"NBA 2K23 at its core is the same great experience that players enjoy each and every year, while also still mired by the unpleasant microtransactions for your MyPlayer. This year's return of the Jordan Challenge, however, takes the game to new heights that it has not felt for a number of years now thanks to the level of authenticity found in the presentation and gameplay surrounding the GOAT Michael Jordan.",
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is a fun yet flawed beat ‘em up. The neat historical aspect and familair faces should appeal to fans, though it’s marred by performance issues and a convoluted map system.",
"If you're looking for a more classical style of game where you can turn off your brain and annihilate wave after wave of enemies as you dodge obscene amounts of enemy fire, Xyanide is for you.",
"It's simply the gameplay, graphics and sound all being at an incredibly high level and it all seemingly complimenting one another to create one of the most satisfying sci-fi/action experiences currently available in gaming.",
"Unfortunately, the creators of Rise of an Empire have managed to make a Settlers game so narrow in scope and so lacking in player control that it's only slightly more interactive than dropping fish flakes in with the Neon Tetras.",
"Summon Night 5 is an SRPG that needs to be played by anyone who likes the genre. It’s a love letter to fans of a somewhat bygone era of Japanese roleplaying games and manages to deliver on nearly all fronts, be it story, characterization, gameplay or presentation.",
"A Total War Saga: Troy is a superb entry to Creative Assembly's strategy series, with both combat and diplomacy proving incredibly addictive. However, there have been a few tweaks to the Total War blueprint in order to accommodate the Bronze Age setting. Hardcore Total War fans may be dismayed by the lack of unit variety, but newcomers may well relish the simplified approach. The new economy system also adds a new depth to diplomacy and strategy, making non-combat play significantly more enjoyable no matter your Total War experience level. And with a smattering of Greek mythology, Troy feels one of the most distinctive entries to the series yet.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan definitely feels old-school in its approach but its vast assortment of super-tough bosses and oodles of extras that are great fun to master make it stand out as an excellent Soulslike. Plus, you can wear goofy jars on your head.",
"Persona 4 Dancing All Night is a delightful departure from the series norm, and even fans that only have a passing knowledge of the franchise will get a kick out of how fun P4DAN really is to play.",
"Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood takes all the best features of his prequel a further step ahead. With strong graphics, always fresh gameplay, an interesting plot and a bit of humor, Bound in Blood reaches the high grades in our rankings, being one of the best FPS in the business.",
"The nuisance of the overworld and the poorly controlled vehicles are the biggest drawbacks, causing a good deal of headache. And yes, the game is much more difficult than the original.",
"Despite having a fun premise and plenty of fighting styles to muck around with, the average fighting mechanics, seemingly random customisation options and lacklustre modes let it down. Reality Fighters isn't broken, but it isn't very good.",
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a cute and addictive game that respects the franchise's formula by offering plenty of levels and multiplayer fun. However, we feel that its full potential is not fulfilled due to the lack of diversity in game modes.",
"On-the-fly switching between ranged and melee combat gives the solid action more depth than you'd expect, and the characters and stages look excellent, complete with nice environmental effects. [Nov 2004, p.75]",
"The vintage jets are a delight for the eyes, and Wings over Europe can challenge your air combat maneuvering and bombing skills as well as many A-list flight sims do. [Aug 2006, p.90]",
"Single- and multiplayer minigames – and, more interestingly, a fully self-contained production-quality construction kit supporting a viral and burgeoning custom-level trading community – round off an already complete package, making Gripshift one of the PSP's finest and full-featured games to date. [Dec 2005, p.110]",
"A Fisherman's Tale offers a story driven experience with some light, but original, puzzles. It's a short game which doesn't do quite enough with its core idea but is a worthwhile experience for the right price.",
"There's little to complain about with Darksiders II, in fact, I pretty much love everything about this game. I won't be surprised to see it end up on quite a few Game of the Year lists at the tail end of the year, which I'm sure you'll come to understand once you lay your hands on it.",
"Alan Wake's American Nightmare provides us with a new story and an arcade mode. It is the arcade mode that stands out and makes us want to play the game over and over. It is however to bad there isn't a multiplayer included. The story is short and it repeats itself but remains worthwhile. American Nightmare is quite enjoyable, but we'd rather play a proper sequel.",
"This game has it all: monsters to capture and raise, upgradeable items and spells, and incredibly rich character customization. I got sucked in to this as badly as I did with both ""Final Fantasy Tactics,"" so that's saying a lot: 50-some great hours, lots. [June 2004, p.97]",
"Don’t let Loop Hero‘s simple appearance fool you; a dense and addictive game, unlike anything else you’ve played, lurks under its retro veneer, waiting to get its claws into you. And once you’ve fallen into the loop, it’ll be hard to get back out again. Building up your character and creating the world around him is gloriously rewarding, and not even death is going to stand in your way.",
"As a budget bundle, Saints Row 4: Re-elected and 'Gat out of Hell' is worth considering if you're looking to waste a few weekends before this year's influx of blockbuster releases.",
"The intuitive mechanics are still as addictive as the first time around, but a larger number of maps and the addition of Salmon Run cements Splatoon 2 as an excellent standalone value.",
"Fans of the new TV series and even older fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will enjoy this title, provided they can ignore the skateboarding and other driving sections of the game.",
"Football is played on the field and this is clearly where the development team focused with Madden NFL 25. The changes to the physics are meaningful and can create opportunities that weren't previously available in the series thanks to BOOM Tech. Getting a perfect hit with Hit Stick 2.0 can be satisfying thanks in part to sound of the pads and the visual cue. Receiver and defender interactions when going for the ball are engaging and the offensive line play is fantastic. The steps EA has taken to make Madden look and sound like Sunday are clear. The holdback comes down to the same experience with the modes in the game, albeit some surface level changes. The new broadcast options and the presentation updates help Madden NFL 25 to feel different.",
"When it comes down to it, The Darkest Faerie plays like a Zelda knockoff and looks like a Spyro ripoff. Save for the mote system, there really isn't anything interesting going on, which would be fine if the execution were better.",
"Boxboy is the ideal game for breaks. The simple design, short levels and learning curve are great. It is addictive, fun and very easy to play when waiting on the bus, so a good game to release on 3DS.",
"Go Mecha Ball is great at delivering fast-paced action thanks to its collision combat. You constantly balance rolling into enemies and firing with your weapons while dodging attacks. The enemies you face constantly attack you and the boss battles are challenging. The game isn’t perfect, as it constantly forces the tutorial on you and you sometimes spend too much time chasing enemies. But for a game that gives you a quick action fix, it’s hard to dislike Go Mecha Ball’s frantic pace.",
"Persona 4: Dancing All Night brings back the deep, familiar characters and introduces them to the rhythm genre in a game that, while short on content and steep in price, is still a blast set to an iconic soundtrack.",
"It reminds us all of the magic Nintendo can cast when it comes to 2D platforming, and whether you are a seasoned player breezing through the game, or a newcomer just getting your goomba-stomping legs, this is an instant classic that is sure to impress.",
"Enough options to keep off-road enthusiasts tearing up the dirt for quite some time, and the physics and damage modeling is a nice surprise. However, Insane, never really makes you say ""Wow!"" It's a solid, but not exceptional racing game that won't lock you up in an asylum (as the title suggests).",
"This is the sort of game that seems destined to go down as a cult classic, but should really be enjoyed by anyone with a 3DS system. It’s a true triumph of gameplay over spectacle, and a hugely engaging experience from start to finish.",
"Overall, MLB 2K6 is a worthy replacement to the beloved MVP MLB franchise. While there are some occasional hiccups and glitches and the fielding is off, these are all issues that can be ironed out over the next year - the game is still pretty fun to play.",
"All the same, this is by far the best of the franchise so far and if you’ve ever considered giving one of the Sherlock Holmes games a go there’s been no better option to start with.",
"Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time is the video game adaptation you were not expecting and won't care about if you are not an hardcore fan of the anime. The game is a weird mix between an old-school 2D side-scrolling and a PS2 era RPG but does not stand out in any of the genre it tries to tackle. However, only once you forget about the core gameplay and simply wander around the aisle of the Academia speaking with Akko's little friends, then you can really start enjoying Chamber of Time. Not for what it is, but for what it is not: a visual novel set within the world of Little Witch Academia starring the cutest hero of all time, Akko!",
"With more polish and character balancing, Midway could have crafted one of the best pick up and play fighters in existence – but combo timing issues hurt the overall score and that’s a shame.",
"On the outside The Last Story appears to be nothing more than a stereotypical role playing game, but look scan be deceiving. It's actually a quick and daring action game that only falls back to its roots during the story. It's a surprising take on the genre, and makes for a very modern experience.",
The AI follows a scripted battle plan that remains virtually unchanged regardless of what strategies you implement against them. To that end the game doesn't have much of a real-time feel.,
"C&C3's graphics are outstanding. You'll see rippling water, detailed map terrain, awe-inspiring weapon special effects, and satisfying explosions. The sound effects are equally good.",
"Forza Horizon 5 turns ""more of the same"" into a mark of true excellence, furtherly polishing and improving on a winning formula and making it exponentially more spectacular on a technical level and more enveloping on an environmental level, and mixing it all with its distinctive driving model, a unique mix of a simulative superstructure with an arcade heart beating beneath the hood.",
"The Sexy Brutale’s repetitive nature bogs down what is otherwise a clever title. Tequila Works’ cast of characters are lovably eccentric and its puzzles are consistently rewarding. Unfortunately, The Sexy Brutale confirms one of the overlooked flaws of time travel: reliving the same day repeatedly can be tedious.",
"Bone: Out from Boneville & The Great Cow Race are good fun even for beginners. The Great Cow Race is much better than the shaky first episode, being more non-linear, having tighter gameplay and expanding on the comic's story instead of just retelling it. [Jan 2007]",
"I went into Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII hopeful that it might be the game to help me break through my difficulty with the strategy genre. Unfortunately, I was only met with an interface poorly optimized for consoles and a “tutorial” that made me more confused than informed.",
"The Thaumaturge combines an unusual setting in 20th century Poland with tactical turn-based battles and a supernatural plot revolving around hidden demons, sometimes exciting decisions and tricky (social) problems. However, the plot and characters tend to get in their own way and stumble over the stiff presentation.",
"The gameplay this time around is much more refined, and even more mainstream one could argue, in an effort to appeal to a broader range of gamers. The missions are much more hectic, intense and dynamic.",
"Reality Fighters is a lackluster beat'em-up, designed around a nice idea but plagued by a broken augmented reality feature and some control and depth issues. Miyagi is a cool addition and the character editor is somewhat decent, but the game is mostly disappointing.",
"Taken for what it is, Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a cool title containing bite-sized content with portable gamers in mind. That said, we doubt you'll find much to dislike.",
"It can be as simple or as mind-bending as you want it to be; either way, you'll be satisfied for many hours on end...Plus, you've got to admit that the Minis are adorable. Creepy and possibly murderous, but adorable all the same.",
"It may not be anything ground-breaking but I feel the title should be regarded as one of the Vita’s best games yet. With vastly improved visuals, animations and control schemes over the mobile version, Real Boxing on the Vita is surely the best version of the game to get.",
"Californium is a pitch perfect visualization of the death rattle of the hippie dream, a glimpse into worlds locked behind the liquid dreams of acid. It is also suffers from design and pacing flaws that take away from the overall experience and limit its audience.",
"Will hold the interest of a devoted WWE fan for a few days, but it doesn't have a wide enough assortment of wrestlers or moves to keep the attention of anyone else for very long. The absence of a create-a-wrestler option is also tragic.",
"The idea that the game of pinball may be used to simulate virtually any other challenging struggle is a good one (since pinball is cool), and Metroid Prime Pinball pulls it off very well--both by being a fun and great-looking pinball experience, and by being a faithful spin-off of one of the best Nintendo games of the past decade.",
"Hotline Miami is a gem of a game. It has satisfying gameplay, an atmosphere that is both disturbing and gripping, and it provokes thoughts like no other game this year. What more could you want? [Dec 2012]",
"Death faces a great trip full of jumps, puzzles and combat. Darksiders II is much better than the first game, with variety and enormity until more than 25 hours. A classic adventure made with precious graphics.",
"It retains about the series' penchant for easy and accessible gameplay wrapped in a retro package. Its simplicity and lack of additional modes could harm long-term enjoyment, but BIT.TRIP VOID is brimming with creative ingenuity that shouldn't be missed.",
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series certainly is the best way for the series to celebrate its 25th anniversary, as with the great improvements it has received, the series is back in the spotlight. The only thing that remains to be seen is what the future holds for the franchise.",
"Just like in real life, the Corvettes on display possess wicked oversteer and, adding insult to injury, grace some of the most lackluster course designs I've ever traversed while good-'ol-boy rock and swanky sax music crackles in the background. [June 2004, p.61]",
"Need for Speed Unbound is a fun racer with some new event types and an unusual yet undeniably attractive visual style. However, it doesn't do a ton to set itself apart from other racers that are currently out there and its story mode can be quite limiting.",
"Catchy storyline on one side, crappy RPG elements on the other… Venetica amazes with stunning visuals and attractive heroine but the game mechanics undermine the overall impression. [Feb 2010]",
"Robust mechanics and some interesting ideas make Hard West 2 an enjoyable sequel, even though it does have its flaws. If you can look past the shallow character development and the occasional trial & error design, it's a solid recommendation, especially if you consider the low price tag.",
"From the ‘no pain, no gain’ training mini-games to the upgradable boxer who forges a career by slowly skilling-up in various attributes, the influence of early boxing simulations can be seen all over Vivid Games’ Real Boxing.",
"Under Siege is a well-done RTS, although a bit too challenging for its own good. Featuring a high caliber production value and control scheme for a downloadable title, there's a lot to like in this maiden voyage for a new studio.",
"The unique abilities of Constantine and scary atmosphere that Bits has established will make your mouth water, but you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone who can tolerate the shoddy gameplay. [Apr 2005, p.120]",
"If you rarely play online or have a slow Internet connection and hate micro-managing, stop reading now and go buy last year's game instead. If you don't fit into either of those molds, then this will be the most satisfying experience playing virtual sports ever.",
"With Undounded, Ridge Racer gets closer to games like Burnout, Blur, or Split Second. It's more accessible, and more aggressive, with a very nice tracks editor and nice multiplayer. Too bad its production values aren't on par with the genre champions, and traditional Ridge Racer fans will probably disappointed by this new orientation.",
"Chamber of Time is in fact a runaway-style dungeon crawler with good arrows to its arch, sliding and light, but very rigid in structure and decidedly elementary in its construction of gameplay.",
"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus delivers a fun mystery-filled visual novel experience, perfect for anyone who is a fan of Danganronpa or similar titles. There are a few frustrating elements here and there, but the whole package is a mostly solid narrative-focused adventure.",
"It is the striking cel-shaded design, though, that elevates Röki just above games such as Year Walk, which is similarly inspired by Scandinavian folklore. The design enhances minor artistic details – whether it’s snow glistening on a treetop or a hostile character’s imposing shadow – to create a more involving experience. Röki’s pleasing aesthetics are well-matched by an absorbing story that always keeps you on your guard.",
"Fans of 4X games set in space will be pleased to know that Endless Space 2 is a real high-quality product. It's well made as well as engrossing. That's it. I really hope that Amplitude's new game wins the same acclaim as another successful cosmic strategy, Stellaris.",
"Even if it does get monotonous sometimes, I certainly can't fault the originality of the pickpocketing idea. The Big Con is not the kind of adventure game I see every day and credit to Mighty Yell for trying something different. I don't know if it's because I was hoping more would be done with the idea or because the game felt too short, but I ultimately came out of this game wanting something more. Maybe that's just the hunger for a bigger score.",
"A chilling fever dream of dystopian hope, After Us takes the mechanics of an atmospheric puzzle-platformer and uses them to create a beautifully unsettling experience that feels a little too real. Its satisfying traversal challenges through gorgeously rendered wastelands provide plenty of engaging gameplay moments for platforming fans, though its relentlessly oppressive environments may prove too harsh for some. Haunting and immersive, but definitely not for the faint of heart.",
"The true misery of Valkyria Revolution is how much of the series’ roots show through, and how much Revolution itself doesn’t know what to do with them. The qualities that defined earlier Valkyria games are mostly vestigial, but Revolution doesn't present anything strong enough or distinct enough to replace them. What it does do often directly conflicts with those legacy bulletpoints, making a game that feels like a bland timesink at its best and a fractured mess at its worst.",
"If this were a mid-level priced game, say $29.99, it would be a bargain, but to charge full price for a game that has so little in the way of off the field content is a tough pill to swallow.",
"While not quite on a par with the PS5’s best graphics, it does a wonderful job conveying the actors’ emotions. And the storyline is tightly written and compelling. You’ll want to get onto the next episode. The gameplay is basic and only time will tell how the choices you make play out over the next four episodes. So for now, episode one is a good start. Very much a Telltale interactive story. And if you’re down with that and not too much actual gaming you’ll be satisfied.",
"It’s not perfect – again Divine Will could play more of an in-your-face role, especially considering how prevalent the societies of the day saw the Gods and their influence on everything. And while the new multiple resource economy makes for more strategic diplomacy, it can also show some of the cracks in the simulation when you’re constantly being badgered for resources for nothing in return. However, A Total War Saga: TROY deserves to be listed among the best strategy experiences in the last few years, and one I’ll find myself returning to over and over again.",
"That its online component is limited to a linear and moderately laggy co-op mode - and therefore feels even more ponderous than the single-player game - does little to spirit this comic book tie-in from gaming purgatory. [July 2008, p.80]",
"Critter Cafe is a soothing and relaxing game in the best of times, filled with cute critters. There's no rush to complete the game and you can take as much time as you want. It does feel like some parts of the game are more complex than necessary. But if you are in need of a cozy critter game, it's hard to beat Critter Cafe.",
"Surpasses the original, giving gamers a title that's worth playing and worth getting addicted to. On the down side it suffers from the same repetitiveness that other sports games have to fight so hard to avoid.",
"Squids Odyssey is a fun, addictive and extremely challenging turn-based RPG with an action twist. Its difficulty level can prove merciless for those less willing to invest their time and energy, but the rewards are more than welcome in this well-designed and well-crafted piece of work.",
"While we wait for a (due) patch for the tate mode, we can definitely say that the offering of Namco Museum is satisfying. The real problem of this collection is not the quality, but the variety. And the absolute absence of extras and/or unlockables, something we really loved in similar products like the SEGA Mega Drive Ultimate Collection.",
"Onimusha: Warlords HD Remaster is intended for those looking for a trip down memory lane, but it won't impress others. It's an interesting historical artifact, but that's about all it has going for it.",
"Rebounding from a weak second episode, Batman: The Enemy Within’s third episode restores my hopes that this season will turn out well. Major developments around Batman’s big secret and strong interactions with Harley Quinn, Selina Kyle, and John make Fractured Mask work, right up until the extremely abrupt ending.",
The sequel to Champions of Norrath offers a neat and entertaining package of addictive hack 'n' slash action - but is it really that difficult to implement a proper story? [Mar. 05],
"It's clearly stated on the box that it isn't suitable for inexperienced players, while those who are experienced enough to explore the new lands it has to offer will certainly find these areas to be extremely challenging and rewarding.",
"B.I.O.T.A. is a short, enjoyable title. It doesn't quite match the retro chops of something like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and it doesn't have a massive twisting map of something like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but it's great for someone looking for a fast-paced action platformer with a retro-style, has stages that are easy to explore (and get a 100% completion at the end), and a story that has the depth of an 80's action movie.",
"It’s a shame that the online aspects are so hit and miss, but the new chapter helps to smooth over that complaint. It’s old school and simple, but if you can look past that you’ll definitely have a blast with Doom II on Xbox Live Arcade.",
"Combining survival elements with looter shooter and MMORPG mechanics, Once Human takes the best from these genres to create an entertaining and functional mix. While not flawless, it captivates with its bizarre world, monster design, and gunplay. The effectiveness of the seasonal system remains to be seen, but it shows promising potential to become a multiplayer staple.",
"Those wanting to roll the dice on Concord will find an excellent FPS full of exciting abilities, intense battles, and eye-popping visuals. The game's character designs, premium price point, and general lack of interest from the public may make it so Concord never really gets a chance, and so potential consumers need to weigh the risks of investing $40 on a game that may be dead before too long. Personally, I am glad to have played Concord and I will continue playing it as much as possible, and will be sad if the day comes when its player count dwindles to the point where it no longer makes sense to support it. Hopefully, Concord defies the odds and becomes one of Sony's long-lasting live service experiments.",
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a faithful and entertaining remaster of two classic PlayStation platformers. Bandai Namco did an excellent job keeping the franchise's identity alive and preserving the faithful combat and platforming. Though it may feel dated by today's standards, those who remember the Klonoa series will love these remasters, and those jumping in for the first time will experience simple platformers from a simpler time in game design.",
"Rocksteady says farewell to the franchise with an utter masterpiece; its best game so far. Each element feels like a love letter to fans and to Batman himself. Batman: Arkham Knight is the perfect conclusion to an excellent saga, and it departs in the same way it once came: leaving us amazed and with great satisfaction.",
"I could go on and on about all of the other bells and whistles, like the importance of spending multitools wisely at upgrade terminals, the incredible procedural generation of the levels and enemies, the more than a dozen modes to play, all of the in-game achievements to earn, and the plentiful secrets, but those are best discovered when you buy this game. If you’ve got a strategic bone in your body, you have to buy this. Go, buy it now. It’s $25 at full price, which might as well be an act of charity considering the quantity and quality of what you’re getting.",
"Hotline Miami is proof that it is possible to create a fresh and addictive action game, even with the game's emphasis on retro. At the same time it evokes truly human feelings the modern-day shooters die trying to deliver.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is amazing. FFVII Remake's excellent battle system is improved even further, the story leaves the player (whether a veteran or newcomer to the series) intrigued to know what will happen and there is an immense amount of content to be explored.",
"It's a good choice if you like management games, particularly considering that there aren't too many options available on consoles. Still, it's repetitive and it feels like it never unleashes its true potential.",
"A Total War Saga: TROY does a good job in retelling the events of the Trojan War by using interesting elements from Greek mythology as well as the Iliad. However, there were times where the controls felt a little stiff, such as troop organization. The game also doesn’t meet its full potential graphically. That said, battles are simplistic to play but difficult to master. Since there are different lead characters to play as, TROY offers plenty of replay value as well as a chance to enjoy some Greek mythology on each run. It's not a perfect game, but fighting the Minotaur is too cool to pass up.",
"This classic franchise is back with good ideas and a poor execution. If you are a hardcore fan of the series or you’re planning on playing with friends, have a look at it. If not, better look elsewhere.",
"If on one hand we appreciate the care from Studio Trigger in narrating the story and the animated cutscenes, on the other we can't ignore the rough gameplay and its limits. The game has still a lot to gift to the fans of the show, but it's hard to suggest the game to anyone else.",
"Coming to a suitable conclusion on 3D Thunder Blade is a difficult proposition; on one hand it's clearly the best of the 3D Classics on a technical level, but on the other hand the source material wasn't a particularly top-notch game to begin with.",
"You’ve got an interesting setting, a ton of material, all kinds of ideas, and a studio that clearly knows what it’s doing. That all of that got combined into something as forgettable as this is pretty disappointing, and it makes it awfully easy to skip past this game without a second thought.",
"It’s really all kind of shame that Those Who Remain is so flawed, because it’s got such a good idea at its core. In better hands, this probably could’ve been a much better game, but as it stands you’re safe avoiding it entirely.",
"Lacking some fan service, the two games within Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series still demonstrate why the franchise is so loved by many. Huge difficulty spikes stop the games being as well balanced as they should be, but the majority of the experience is a blast. It’s fun to negotiate the well-designed worlds and collect up everything they have to offer. You’ll just wish the rewards were more substantial.",
"There are tried-and-tested action-game formulae in Sonic Colours, and while they're consistently well-executed, there's little inherently new or innovative on show. For me, Sonic Colours' pace and thrill-power overcome these concerns. It's a simple, neon-tinged blast of action gaming, and sometimes, that's all you really want.",
"Little pieces like a sprawling sidequest system, additional RPG-lite conversation trees, getting a ""This is the story so far…"" recap any time you click 'continue' from the main screen, the beautiful and incredibly-scaled heavily-varied environments, and the depth of the nuanced and familiar loot system all come together to support a fantastic storyline.",
"The game&#146;s sound is as mediocre as its gameplay. Wacky, overdone effects, plenty of cheap voice-acting, some themes that sound like cheap imitations of Indiana Jones tracks, and then the occasional latin-sounding pipes for a touch of authenticity comprise the bulk of the audio.",
"With the opportunity for your present success to impact your future prospects, Into the Future adds some nice new elements to the Sims 3 experience. Not for those who prefer to stay in their Sims' house, this expansion is larger than you might expect for a franchise preparing their new installment.",
"A nice selection of classic games with a good customization options for each title, but there are some key titles missing, as well as those documents or that extra information you would expect from a ""museum"".",
"It is a true pleasure to discover a beloved franchise like Total War that uses the Trojan War as a background. It is a great RTS, with some fantastic artistic value and and a few novelties that make it really interesting for this series. Nevertheless, some mechanics like the economy are a bit under-exploited, especially in mid-game until the end. Difficulty feels very odd with enemies who use and abuse the agent system to sabotage your faction.",
"Despite some flaws and a none to friendly learning curve, Drakensang: The Dark Eye is still an enjoyable RPG that's packed with plenty to do and a combat system that eventually grows into something special.",
"Overall, Button City has more depth than I anticipated and the replayability is high if you fall in love with the mini games. Main story can be completed in under 6 hours, but there is more fun to be had after with the mini arcade games, and finishing side quests. The story is touching and has a really emotive meaning behind it. The characters are designed well, and are utterly charming and I can imagine some good merch coming out from their cute faces. The music is a bop, the art style is charismatic but there are a few hitches along the way. Movement speed can slow your game down a lot. There are a few technical bumps, but I would recommend for anyone who wants to free flow through an adventure narrative of Fennel and his Friends.",
"Monaco: What’s Yours is Mine is yet another game that illustrates just what kind of gems can come out of the indie gaming scene. It’s refreshingly original in terms of visual design, unique in its approach to the stealth game genre, and it offers a load of co-op fun that makes it an absolute steal at the default $14.99 USD Steam price, to say nothing of the price you get with the 4-title bundle option.",
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is a side-scrolling brawler developed with love, full of humor and surprisingly rich in content. You won’t find a more charming series in this genre and Three Kingdoms shows how much you can still squeeze out of it by improving its formula.",
"A pleasantly weird update, then. It offers warm familiarity, with a safe selection of modes and a reassuringly lovely pile of new skins, alongside tiny, precision bursts of innovation like the shuffle block. It's another incremental improvement - but, if you ask me, this has always been a game that Sony's handheld needs if it's to feel complete. Lumines will be wedged in the Vita's card slot for months to come.",
Heroes have returned in very good shape. Part six of the Might & Magic saga comes with a great campaign and less micromanagement and the pure joy of exploring is still there. [Nov 2011],
"Ultimately, this is a game which will not be for everyone. That high level of complexity will be a barrier to a lot of players. But if you have the patience and desire to spend a lot of time picking through the intricacies of the game, then it’s a very rewarding experience and one which I heartily recommend.",
Kingdom Hearts 3 seems as if it may finally be coming in the relatively near future and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue serves as an excellent appetizer for those waiting.,
"If you work at learning the game, and view it as something that’s not necessary Castlevania proper, Judgment can provide a decent romp. If you're looking for a good lighthearted fighter, Judgement is outclassed by Brawl. However, if you like Soul Calibur but don’t own a PS3 or Xbox 360, Judgment is your only real alternative, and it’s not as terrible as people have been saying.",
"Nagging control issues aside, A Fisherman’s Tale is a charming PlayStation VR game that I found to be a total joy to experience - the same joy I felt playing Astro Bot: Rescue Mission. As far as first-person virtual reality experiences go, this makes the medium so worthwhile. Shooting zombies and exploring derelict space stations is fun in VR but could easily be reproduced and playable as a regular console title. I couldn’t fathom playing A Fisherman’s Tale without VR and experiencing the same feeling of wonder and delight. Consider this an essential addition to your PSVR library next to Beat Saber, Moss, and Astrobot: Rescue Mission.",
"Crush delivers in every sense of the word: originality, playability, and visuals--it's easily among the prettiest puzzle games I've ever seen--and will keep your PSP off the charger for many a sleepless night. [June 2007, p.82]",
"Madden 25 is slightly better than Madden 24 in every way, but with only Franchise Mode and presentation truly noticeable upgrades. If you own College Football 25, feel will be familiar, and its rosters capable of import.",
"Beyond Eyes most certainly is not a game for everyone. It's a noble attempt to show life with a disability through a clever mechanic, but sadly at times it forgets it is also a video game.",
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a fantastic game that is perfect for newcomers to the Puzzle Bobble series. This title has fun, addicting gameplay, lots of different modes and levels, and is presented beautifully. While it has some flaws such as its annoying voice acting and lackluster story, the game is still enjoyable throughout the runtime. Overall Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a fantastic game that you should pick up if you are interested in puzzle games or arcade games.",
"After Us presents a strong message about planet conservation and wildlife preservation. However, weak gameplay and hollow-level design make the game a running simulator rather than an engaging platformer.",
"If there's an award for game feel, Rollerdrome wins it by a country mile. Roll7 has crafted a short but supremely sweet experience that feels incredible to engage with. No matter whether you're performing tricks or blasting enemies, its addictive loop will have you coming back for more. Complemented by a phenomenal, colourful art style and a real sense of speed, flow, and motion, Rollerdrome rivals the very best Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games.",
"Never has putting a family tree together been so much fun. I couldn't put down The Roottrees are Dead once I started playing it, leaving me feeling like a true detective, searching web pages, library archives and more to piece together this intriguing family's history. This is a must-play for any puzzle fan.",
"Rogue Mage lacks the scope and ambition of Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, but despite that provides lots of fun thanks to its addictive, well-balanced gameplay. It’s also a great way to get acquainted with Gwent.",
"If you're not fully convinced or scared off, give it a rental and try it, particularly if you're a big fan of RPGs and want something a little more plain and old-school. Not everyone is going to like it, but those who do will probably love it.",
"Thanks to a clunky camera and a very dated system this remake of Onimusha doesn't hold up. It's even apparent in the unskippable cutscenes. The atmosphere is great, but that's about it.",
While the missions are well planned - important considering it’s called Th3 Plan - the cheesy dialogue and the 70’s synth-bass feels like they were all stolen from some bad movie that never wanted them in the first place.,
"Overall, Revita is a fun and challenging twin-stick roguelite game that offers players some different and exciting gameplay features to learn and master. There are better roguelites out there, but why not try them all?",
"The story campaign entertains and the multiplayer modes entice you to come back after the credits roll, but the out-of-place melee segments, polish issues, and dropped features from the first game make it fall short.",
"NASCAR Kart Racing is a solid kart racing game, but its biggest flaw is just that there's so little to make it stand out. It's so amazingly similar to Mario Kart Wii, and the latter is a better, more memorable game in every way possible.",
"At every turn, Forza Horizon 5 impresses in ways few games have. From the first mile, I was on the edge of my seat. With so much to do in such a relentlessly gorgeous world, I suspect it won’t be long before I get the itch to jump back into the driver’s seat of my favorite car. Even amidst a competitive racing field, Forza Horizon 5 is a finely tuned supercar.",
"Wytchwood may only be a 10 – 15 hour romp, but those hours are packed to the brim with exploring, crafting, puzzle-solving, storytelling, world-building, and more. A subtly magical experience, Wytchwood’s secrets slowly open up over the course of the game in such a nuanced way, you’ll be eagerly watching out of the corner of your eye for novelty from start to finish. Wytchwood made my bog witch dreams come true, and if you love a good fetch quest game, I’m positive this will be your cup of witches’ brew too.",
"Tracking issues can hamper some of the games, leading to missing a save in air hockey, or some off kilter shots in pool, but with updates, additional games, and continued support, SportsBarVR could end up being the defacto virtual reality hangout platform for PS4 players.",
"Its simple design and perfectly-balanced difficulty level mean that it's sure to resonate with players of all skill levels, and whether it's being chipped away at during morning commutes or digested in its entirety over a weekend, Qbby's tale shows that a minimalistic game can be just as satisfying as a triple-A title.",
"Fair but glitched, Calling's one of the most interesting proposals from Hudson in the last few months, a nice horror adventure in which gamers will discover the same gameplay that we saw in Project Zero or Ju-On, based once again in the stereotypical Japanese horror movies. It's your best pick if you're looking for some fun -- for while it lasts.",
"Technically, the large swarms of bugs are impressive, but otherwise the game looks dated and sounds weak. The fun comes mainly from the game's respect of its source material. The boss fights are incredibly tedious, though. [Dec 2005]",
"I really, really like New Super Mario Bros. Wii...[But i]t plays it safe with established gameplay with very little in the way of new innovation. It also lacks online multiplayer in a generation where such a feature is expected.",
"No one ever joined my public game and I never found anyone’s to join. Not the games fault in a way, just means not many people are playing it online. There is nothing about the game that is bad, it’s just a little above alright. Lacking in features and simple, it’s a fine game to play. That’s it. Just fine.",
"Drakensang offers around 40-50 hours of gameplay depending on how many side quests you tackle, meaning there's plenty to be getting on with, and with a well written storyline and surprisingly good visuals, it really is a noteworthy all round package.",
"The Settlers: Rise of an Empire is the most fulfilling game in the series, adding easy-to-play charisma to the usual Middle Ages economics and trimming much of the micromanagement that made playing past releases in the series as much fun as doing your homework.",
"Has a surprising amount of depth for a GBA action RPG. The leveling system is pretty unique and engaging and the forging system is very deep. However, the controls are clumsy and frustrating and the teammate AI is very lousy.",
"I would not recommend it as a single-player game. It simply doesn’t have enough flesh on the bones to be played that way for more than a few days. Fortunately, Crusader was never meant to be played alone.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is the game we hoped for last year. With a slight delay, the Vancouver team has partially restructured the franchise, giving it a refreshed spirit. While it’s still rooted in the classic FIFA formula, the revamped modes add depth and deliver the best single-player experience in years without sacrificing multiplayer or the importance of Ultimate Team. The new HyperMotionV physics and FC IQ tactical engines provide a solid new foundation for the series, enhancing both strategy and visuals. Player models have improved, Rush is a delight, and the overall experience is now more fun, varied, and visually appealing than ever.",
"As the latest incarnation of the series, Ridge Racer Unbounded switches focus to violent crashes and destructible environment. And it works! By delivering a great driving experience, this game takes the top position of arcade racers.",
"King Arthur’s problems begin with its controls. I am fully aware that this is an action game, but it is not one with much depth to it by any means. So why are not one, not two, but five attack buttons needed? The answer: They aren’t.",
"Solid, honest, and fun – but ultimately too straightforward for its own good, Commandos: Origins neither disgraces the series nor breathes new life into it. It sticks rigidly to the genre’s old-school roots without really trying to modernize or innovate. That nostalgic conservatism isn’t exactly a flaw, but it does mean the game fails to leave a lasting impression. You’ll have a good time sneaking through WWII battlefields, but chances are, you’ll forget the mission as soon as it’s over.",
"Three games in one it may be, but the sum total of Razing Storm is disappointment, and a reminder that the Time Crisis franchise lost its way a long time ago. [Christmas 2010, p.111]",
"With a competitive Freestyle mode, Urban Trial Playground would likely have earned itself a spot in the roster of local multi games I play with my roommates. I would have loved to compete with them for high scores in UTP’s impeccably designed courses. Unfortunately, UTP’s multiplayer only offers the lesser of its two modes, which means I’ve had all the enjoyment there is to have with it. I’ll think fondly of it, but like those ’90s Capri Sun commercials, its days are past.",
"Loop Hero's cleverly stripped-down RPG concept demands attention for as long as it takes you to work out the clear ""best"" way to guide each hero class, and its fantastically dark story setup stands out as one of the best in years.",
"One of the most real military games I've seen in a very long time. Even outperforming ""America's Army,"" which was a pretty good game. This is by far my new favorite of the Tom Clancy games.",
"Stronghold Crusader 2 is not what we’ve hoped: right now the game doesn’t come close to its great predecessor. Still, there are some original ideas to be found here, but thanks to all the bugs it feels like this game has been released too soon.",
"A major disappointment, considering the game has been in development for so long we definitely had some high hopes for the game, but unfortunately the title just isn't that impressive.",
It could have been a fun trivia game to play for a few sessions if it only had a good consideration of pace between rounds and had let us the choice to not use Power Plays to slow down our opponents... and the game.,
"It's a fan-frikken-smabulous game. It's the kind of game that'll feed your gaming needs and desires no matter what level you enter it at... The best platform... sorry, character action game on PlayStation 2 to date? You bet your spring loaded arse it is.",
"While it has obvious areas for improvement — its level design, its online functionality, its visuals — Resident Evil Revelations 2 has a strange sort of confidence in what it's trying to do that the series has needed for some time now.",
"Unlike ""Supreme Commander,"" it isn’t a cerebral game - it's all about slaughtering your enemies by using gross, macro-level tactics. And, doing it all as fast as possible - if ever there was an arcade RTS, Command and Conquer is it. The main problem is that it doesn’t do anything new.",
This is a robust collection that allows series completionists to enjoy the entire franchise in just a few compilations – which will become only two when the PS4 version of the 1.5 and 2.5 Remix comes out in March.,
"A wonderful soundtrack and a visual style which is simple but appealing finish setting the tone for Wattam. While it’s a simple, direct game, during my time with it, I almost constantly had a huge grin on my face. Takahashi's brand of weird works for me and even all these years after Katamari, that's still the case. If his style works for you, I think you'll have a great time with Wattam. It may not last you long but it's a time that will stay with you which is worth celebrating.",
"The game isn’t hard. You don’t need twitch reflexes or a firm grasp on how to use an analog stick. It feels a lot like a Lego game in that regard. All you need to enjoy Knights and Bikes is a sense of adventure and a willing friend. If like me, you’re constantly looking for something to play with a loved one who only has a passing interest in video games, this game is definitely one I’d recommend.",
"Easily the greatest party game on the market today. While that isn&#146;t saying a whole lot since anything that isn&#146;t Mario Party is usually schlock and unworthy of anything but the bargain bin, it still proves that there&#146;s plenty of spunk within the series.",
"While it has its flaws, it's paced well, full of action, and managed to keep us smiling all the way to the end. With a tweak here and a polish there, Ritual could really be onto something good. Bring on part two.",
"For any fan of the warhammer franchise it’s a must have, but even someone who knows nothing about it would still have an unbelievable experience. Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide scores [80] as some people might be slightly put off by its online only gameplay.",
"For what it is - the Jak universe plugged into a juiced ""GTA"" mold - Jak II is damn close to being a perfect game. You just have to want <I>this</I> game. I took some convincing, but the way has been opened. I'll live with the boogie. [Oct 2003, p.64]",
"It doesn't do anything particularly outstanding to persuade MotoGP virgins to dip their toes in two-wheeled waters, but to say the game does little right would also be doing it a disservice. This instalment of MotoGP feels like a new beginning for the sub-genre, and as such deserves sampling by most. The petrol heads amongst us, especially.",
"A game that lacks anything even remotely compelling, a short, repetitive, bland, dull mess of a game, the only redeeming feature of which is that Perlman's Hellboy is effortlessly likeable.",
There are enough reasons to consider purchasing F1 2013. The Formula 1 cars control better than in previous installments and thanks to new modes there are easier ways to get into some action quickly. Unfortunately it feels kind of dated on an audiovisual level. Having to pay extra for classic content isn’t modern either.,
"Metro: Last Light does belong in the company of Half-Life, though. It's an unusual, meticulously detailed shooter inextricable from its environment – making its refuge in the railways of Moscow all the more apt. The survival and shooting aspects engage with what is considered valuable in the world, and both leave ample room for moments of solace, exploration and concise violence.",
"Great, creepy fun. Although weak combat and arcadey features flaw this endeavor, it's simple to play and very immersive with plenty of dark atmosphere, cool magic effects, and more shuffling zombies than you can fit in a mall.",
"Despite not being a movie conversion, The Science of Evil suffers from the problems that usually affect this unlucky genre. It has a good co-op element, but the repetitive gameplay, the poor graphics, and a problematic camera are only a few examples from a journey to hell that not even the fans would like to take. [Sept 2008]",
"It looks like a simple little game, but give it some time, acquire more cards and it will surprise you with its unfolding complexity and addictiveness. Admittedly, initial loops are boring, but ultimately I spent hours on end with Loop Hero and had tons of fun. [05/2021, p.38]",
"Platinum identified that a world subject to infinite player Ginsu-knifing is a world without obstruction. Revengeance revives its signature sword play as the show stopper it was always meant to be, but does it in a calculated manner. The result is an action game that never overstays its welcome.",
"Essentially, Ratatouille would be a perfect purchase for somebody fitting any two of these criteria: a young child, somebody relatively unskilled at gaming or a huge fan of the film on which the game is based.",
"There are zombies? Really? I don’t care. I’d rather die than to stay on the beautiful island Panai where all I can do is participate in a boring fight for survival, filled with collectable overkill and horrible quest design.",
Nowhere Studios have an artistic eye that spoke in a unique and moving way to me at first but the technical problems voided that emotional connection and Monochroma ended up being a slog rather than a joy.,
"Not a blast to play, but at least this side scrolling beat´em up with light RPG elements is not a mere fan service. It´s fun to play in the short term but gets a bit tedious after that.",
"Wolverine is a great character, and he's the best there is at what he does even in videogames. This is a game full of action, blood and great visuals, with epic battles and unforgettable situations. It has its flaws, but overall, it's a good game for lovers of action-packed games.",
"Without the distractions of combat, hub worlds and pointless Wii-mote waggling, Sonic Team has been able to put all its efforts into creating a platformer Sonic fans can be proud of. The quality of the level design is what separates this from previous disappointments, and it's certainly better than that on show in Sonic 4.",
"My experience with Arma III contained equal doses of pleasant surprise, delight, feeling of emptiness after finishing single player missions, and longing for more. If you’re mainly interested in the single player campaign, I advise you to wait at least for the first DLC before buying this game. [CD-Action 11/2013, p.58]",
"I found Legrand Legacy an exceedingly tough game to score. Although it clearly has its flaws, I enjoyed the roughly 40 hours I spent with it all the same. The small but immensely talented development team may simply have tried to do just a little too much here, possibly to the detriment of character development and script writing. There are things it does well, including its great audiovisual quality, but it doesn't truly stand out in any meaningful way. SEMISOFT wished to create a love letter to JRPGs, and perhaps it did that in a most unintentional way. Legrand Legacy manages to capture much of the indelible charm of the JRPGs to which it pays homage through its rough-around-the-edges execution.",
"Despite the gimmicks, shallow story Sonic Colours is one of the stronger Sonic games SEGA has brought us in recent times. Providing gamers with a fantastic looking retro dose of Sonic action thats hard not to like, it's a Sonic game for the ""Sonic"" generation!",
This puzzle-platformer’s puzzles and platforming might be merely alright – and the music is a proper irritant – but Pikuniku is full of so much cheer and loveliness elsewhere. It’s bursting with character in a story that’s equal parts silly and uplifting.,
"Elsweyr is full of all kinds of wonderful things from the Elder Scrolls series—ranging from dragons and necromancers to Khajiit and assassins—but the main story doesn't pack as much of a punch as what we saw in ESO's previous two expansions. Fortunately, there's still plenty to love about the memorable side quests and the fantastic new Necromancer class.",
"Time Crisis: Razing Storm might not be the blockbuster shooter title that the PlayStation Move is waiting for, but if you're looking for a fun arcade shooter to play with a friend, this might be your cup of tea.",
"A solid introduction to the world of Switch-powered cardboard craftables. It may get a bit tedious and repetitive during its laborious building and simplistic play sessions, but the creative freedom it allows once you dig a little deeper is truly something extraordinary.",
"Clever puzzles, a decent story and beautiful pixel graphics make up Alwa’s Legacy‘s strengths. But there’s little here that makes it stand out from a sea of more superior games in the genre. If you enjoy classic Metroidvania-style platforming, Alwa’s Legacy is worth a play – but don’t expect an experience that will blow you away.",
"LEGO City Undercover offers hours of gameplay in a sandbox-style game based on the LEGO franchise. Chase McCain lives in a rich world with lots of content, vehicles and missions. Using the Wii U GamePad you will explore this colorfur city made by pieces.",
"Visionary, magical and unforgettable, Majora's Mask is perhaps the most peculiar and simultaneously complete chapter in the series, a true milestone for the fans of this saga, and for those who generally loves this digital media called video game that makes us laugh, cry and dream.",
"Fight'N Rage has a name that suggests an old school beat'em-up and that's exactly what it is, a tribute to some of the classic names of this dimension of gaming that was so popular in decades past. But that's not the only thing that Fight'N Rage gets right - its gameplay mechanics amount of content, different endings and top notch audiovisual environment all contribute to make this one classic-style beat'em-up that is worthy to enter the Nintendo Switch of any fan of the style.",
"This year's installment features overachieving impact players who are highlighted on the field during games, your very own dorm room (where you can check your stats, store your trophies, etc…), and revamped training games that are addictive as beer nuts.",
"Polished online interface + incredible sense of speed (i.e. bikes out of hell!) + perfect arcade handling (wheelies anyone?) + plethora of modes to tinker with + no ""GT3: A-Spec""-type customization or realistic physics = the best PS2 arcade racing ever made.",
"Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a great realisation of the western genre both in single player and online in multiplayer. It truly is an authentic western experience that builds on the foundations of its predecessor and will be lapped up by western fans worldwide. If it wasn't for its lack of single player longevity and its few technical hang ups, some of which hamper the gameplay, the game would easily be shooting in the 80's.",
Thanks to the half-decent camera you can also get right down into the action to appreciate the slaughter even more. It&#146;s worth getting Operation Genesis for this opportunity alone.,
"The final expansion to The Sims 3 is simply very good. The idea of a future, that your Sims can shape, is really interesting. What's more, we get new skills and jobs, a ton of cool things and gadgets, dreaming and plumbots (a very good idea!). Into the Future is a product comparable to the best of the series - it is a worthy end to The Sims 3 line of games.",
"Honestly, there isn't much more to the game than this. You're just building simple structures and hoping the physics don't send it tumbling down. However, if you're looking for a lighthearted, easy-going co-op game, this will scratch that itch.",
"Those previously unaware of Time Crisis will find the whole affair bafflingly cheesy, but devotees of the franchise will love Razing Storm as a package, although most will surely agree that it should have been billed as Deadstorm Pirates, with a free copy of Time Crisis: Razing Storm thrown in.",
"As an attractively illustrated adventure game with very mild difficulty levels, Nancy Drew: The Deadly Secret of Olde World Park probably isn’t a bad choice for younger gamers or fans of Nancy Drew who might enjoy it as a short, interactive comic book. If you’re looking for something like the PC Nancy Drew games on the DS, though, this title is probably not for you.",
"Is Th3 Plan worth playing? Even as a $15 budget title, it really isn't. From the inconsistent voice acting to the rudimentary visuals, the tedious gameplay, and the lack of replay value, you have better things with which to occupy your time.",
"If you decide to by Time Crisis: Razing Storm, you will do so for the sole benefit of owning Time Crisis 4 and Deadstorm Pirates, two excellent arcade titles structured around the concept of ""fun for the sake of fun"".",
"If you wanted more of the same then Superhot: Mind Control Delete's idiosyncrasies will probably frustrate you more than entertain, but if you look beyond them you'll find a wickedly addicting game beneath. Mind Control Delete may rely too heavily on rolling the dice to extend its playtime, but fans willing to put their qualms aside will discover yet another fine entry in the series.",
"It's easy: if you like skate games like Tony Hawk's or Jet Set Radio and shooter games with clever mechanics and lots of spectacle, Rollerdrome it's the explosive combination you didn't know you needed.",
"Zombie Panic's gleeful initial charm and quirky visual appeal wane once the frenzied, bullet-spraying repetition kicks in after a couple of stages. It's evidently one of those games best sampled in small doses.",
"If you have friends who enjoy videogames, this is one to play together. It's made specifically for that -- and yeah, it's got all the painstaking collectibles and supplemental multiplayer challenges you already assumed it did, so you're going to play it for quite a while. And if you just want a serious challenge, play alone and revel in the pure joy of death. Either way, it's a damn fine Mario game.",
"With weak exploration which tends towards being more tedious, and even exhausting, combat which trips over itself to constantly interrupt the player, and an overall feeling of awkwardness in the presentation, getting through The Thaumaturge's low moments can be a real struggle. However, on the other side is a compelling and interesting political slow burn which weaves the role of magic and Thaumaturgy into real historical scheming, even if that means the more interesting aspects of the world take a backseat. This is alongside an engaging core combat loop and some excellent creature designs. If you can stomach the slow start and are willing to play into the game's more obtuse aspects, particularly the walls of emotive text, The Thaumaturge is sure to be another exciting CRPG for you.",
The people over at Playground Games proved -yet again- that they are capable of delivering the very best arcade racing experience. Forza Horizon 5 is truly a superb game in a league of its own.,
"All in all, Lumines Electronic Symphony is an outstanding puzzle game and a worthy addition to the series. However, I think its price of $40 at retail and $36 on the PSN is a bit too steep for the relatively lean amount of content here.",
"As funny as setting enemies against each other is, however, it doesn’t make Clash: Artifacts of Chaos’ combat any more enjoyable – which makes it pretty similar to the rest of the game. It’s awkward, it’s clunky, it never fully explains itself, and I strongly suspect that that’s the case whether you’ve played older Zeno Clash games or not.",
"Despite the high overall level of polish, Assault Heroes 2 feels like an overlong expansion pack - and at $10, it's one that costs twice the price of the original. Good game? Yes, but a tough sell.",
"From a presentation standpoint, Showdown is an excellent additional to the Shovel Knight kingdom, but with multiplayer being restricted to couch only, it doesn’t hold up as well as its platforming brethren.",
"Hellbound may not be great but it’s a short, sweet thrill ride while it lasts. The action is nice and fast with the guns packing a solid punch, and all the weapons earn their place in the arsenal. The length of the game means its limits don’t have a chance to feel grating and the sameness of the enemies is nicely offset by the personality of the levels. Even after the game is over there are still a handful of arena levels to play in, trying to survive as long as possible to claim a spot on its leaderboards. Hellbound may be restrained by its limits but there’s no question it does a lot within them and it’s good bloody fun while the ride lasts.",
"Even after more than 20 years, smashing monsters and looting to your hearts content is as addicting as ever. A fantastic visual overhaul and some much-needed improvements make this the best version of Diablo 2 so far. However, a lot of outdated mechanics remain untouched, from shared loot and uneven balancing to an overflowing inventory that constantly interrupts the action. Even basic stuff like stackable gems or some useful tutorial screens didn't make it into this remaster. Blizzard is clearly catering to fans of the original, even if that means the remaster may never reach its full potential.",
"I feel a little weird having gone this far without even a mention of the start of Episode 3, but with the enjoyment I am getting out of this being so heavily reliant on the story and its turns, mentioning them, no matter how briefly, feels a bit like a betrayal. There are a number of moments that I would love to bring up, especially ones that deal with Bruce’s ability to trust and how those moments being left up to the player brings me a substantial amount of joy, but I think I’ll save those for the finale. For now, I am happy to say that Batman: The Enemy Within is Telltale at their best. We are halfway through this season, and I am equal parts jumping for joy and pulling out my hair to see where this ends up.",
"If the online multiplayer had modern social features and an engaging story worthy of the IP, Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown would be as essential as other recent entries in the series. Unfortunately, the fundamental issues leave it hard to recommend. In lieu, I'd suggest replaying Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall instead.",
"I can’t imagine that anyone would be blown away by any one part of Wuppo. The art is wonky, the combat is simple, and the lore is kind of silly. But it’s when these aspects combine that Wuppo’s charm begins to appear, and it’s a charm that can’t be stifled by any flaws.",
"On the whole, Black Book is a fun adventure that does enough to stand out from the crowd. The combat and card play are different enough from its contemporaries that those looking for a more traditional entry point into deck-building can give it a shot, even if the game begins to wear out its welcome by the end of its thirty or so hours. The real reason to stick with it is the great attention to detail regarding Slavic folklore and how it weaves into the gameplay in ways that can make the player feel clever. It won’t be the flashiest game anyone plays this year, but there is a good time to be had.",
"Even with the mildly troublesome camera issues, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is a smart-buy for comic book fans and action gamers. Its four scenarios will keep you busy for a while, and the swinging action shouldn't be missed. Take it for a swing.",
"With so much effort put into Being Whatevercraft, it's a real shame that a bit more time wasn't spent on really trying to surpass it, rather than just being a solid game that's as ultimately memorable as a disembowel movement. [Dec 2004, p.89]",
"MM3D both suffers from its allegiance to the Zelda ethos while also etching out a unique position within the franchise’s context. Ultimately, although its attempts at innovation have mixed success, the core Zelda gameplay is still fun, endearing, and challenging.",
"As an arcade space shooter, Xyanide doesn't break any new ground, but it is a solid entry that is fun. The flaws aren't enough to diminish an otherwise fun time with the original Xbox.",
"In the end, Knowledge is Power isn't a bad trivia game. The questions are good, and it's an annoyance that players can't turn off the power-ups, but they're nice to have if someone is dominating the game. However, the slower pace prevents Knowledge is Power from becoming a big party game, something that other trivia games can handle with ease. While it may not be the go-to video game for big gatherings, it's a nice title to have around in between sessions of the bigger party games.",
"With more maps, classes, the ability to server browse and customization options promised there's a lot of potential in Forge, but what you're buying now feels like a beta with a great foundation.",
"The game's third-person combat is pretty much D.O.A.-target, shoot, repeat, etc.-but things pick up considerably once you acquire your chainsaw and boomstick (aka 12-gauge shotgun). And things pick up again after you partner up with a wise-cracking midget Deadite.",
"There are certainly problems with the title, but the same gore and humor from the movies is intact for the game, which is key. Fans will love hearing their hero back in action again, and while short lived, will enjoy taking down the deadites as well.",
"New Star GP is a casual, arcade game that aims for a particular aesthetic and gameplay that is in short supply these days. I'm glad it exists, and I'm touched by the strong love of motorsport it has present. I think it's a fun videogame to play, even with friends, but I think -empirically- it's an idea that is directly intended for those who enjoy the sport.",
"Dead or School is an interesting and ambitious RPG with hack and slash elements that features a surprisingly interesting plot and a good, sharp, fun combat system. The game's limitations are obvious, however, and the game's performance isn't always the sharpest but fans of RPGs will appreciate this effort.",
"Pucelle's rather excellent localization brings the game world to hyper-kinetic, over-the-top life and that, (coupled with many, many gameplay hours), is more than enough to entice RPG fans into Pucelle's worthy fold. [July 2004, p.32]",
"With all of the games available on Xbox Live, it’s pretty hard to find something that actually feels completely original, but Elements of Destruction does just that. The game’s blending of strategy and action, mixed in with a meteorological arsenal that would bring a tear to Willard Scott’s eye, all come together to make this a title that deserves a spot on most Xbox 360 owners’ extended forecast.",
"Trek to Yomi is a trip to historic Japan in the style of Kurosawa movies. The unique monochrome look will immerse you in the game, and the fights are dynamic and realistic. You will reach the ending really quickly, but the game will leave a good impression. In Game Pass, this is a clear choice that you should not miss.",
"The Sexy Brutale is a moody experience of exploration, secrecy and melancholy, fueled by smooth jazz. Distinguished by its own mechanical design and great visual presentation, the game is a great surprise recommended for the puzzle-loving enthusiasts.",
"A weird experience, short, unique and disturbing. A mix of action and strategy that will absorb you and won't let you stop until you finish it. Not for everyone, but absolutely recommended for those players looking for something new.",
To enjoy this game properly you are going to need a keyboard and a mouse -- two things that are readily available on the PC -- so you might as well plan on going for that version instead.,
"Most twin stick shooters are good fun for a while, and this is no exception. Cutting down orks with constant streams of bullets is definitely entertaining, especially with a friend. It provides terribly little variation though, and you won't be sad when it's over.",
"Much like OlliOlli World, Rollerdrome strikes the perfect balance between engaging gameplay, score-chasing, and challenging progression, this time with an ingenious shooting/skating premise. It’s so much fun and I couldn’t put it down.",
"Focusing on stealth, Evotinction proves that games of the genre are not boring if they constantly stimulate the players' creativity. Its story is complex and full of loose ends, so maybe it's worth leaving it aside and enjoying the beautiful and hostile scenarios of the HERE facility.",
"South of Midnight is by far the best game Compulsion has crafted. I love the story, characters, and world. The unique graphics are gorgeous to look at, and the combat is fun and interesting. Being on Game Pass is just the cherry on top. There is a lot to love here and another great game from Xbox this year. Their cadence finally seems to be in place and Xbox owners are eating well. Definitely recommended for just about anyone who enjoys action-adventure games.",
"There’s a lot to love when it comes to Griefhelm and whilst that initial difficulty will be off-putting to some, I recommend you persevere. Whilst combat doesn’t hold a huge amount of depth, the variety in gameplay modes was appreciated and it features some challenging 2D combat, nice aesthetics and enjoyable multiplayer. The inability to save campaign progress is frustrating, but overall, the game took me by surprise, and I very much recommend it.",
"Saturnalia should be on any horror fan’s radar this year. A twisted story combined with a superb art style, nerve-shredding gameplay and expertly crafted design will have you praising and cursing the creative genius to put roguelike mechanics into a horror game. This Italian town has a horrific history you’ll both love and hate to venture into, but you’ll be compelled to uncover it nonetheless.",
"The Sexy Brutale is a delectable slice of murder and mystery. The exquisite art design, twisted puzzles, and excellent audio design combines to create a truly memorable experience. The unique setting and thoughtful tale will remain in the memory long after the case has been closed.",
"Concord feels like a game that was made when Overwatch was just getting popular, but never kept up with any development in the industry. The action is decent, but a lack of good content, personality, and unique ideas do the game in.",
You’ll need an appreciation for the cube itself to get the most out of this - and you may want to destroy whoever programmed the chirpy music and decided to call the cubes “cubies” and give them a story - but it’s a solid value for puzzle players.,
"The debut title from Darjeeling in an ambitious one, but somehow it misses the target. Considered as a pure homage to Philip K. Dick, it's even too didactic; as a first-person interactive adventure, it's pretty basic and repetitive. But if you're a fan of P.K.D., you'll find some interesting and fascinating stuff.",
"Refreshingly light-hearted, brief, and full of good vibes, Wattam is the kind of game that everyone can easily settle down with. It’s a magical experience centered on friendships and connection, finding out how each unique skill can help everybody out, despite all being different sizes, shapes, and colors. There’s a simple joy that comes from playing Wattam, a feeling that many other games just can’t match. Wattam is a delightful, fun, and uplifting game filled with laughter, teamwork, and all the things that make your heart feel warm and fuzzy.",
"For some the difficulty may be a little frustrating and later on in the game it seems a little fruitless to fork out on weapons, but it's balanced, clever and exciting, almost forcing you to have one more go.",
"Games feature furious battles over centrally located resources, enormously powerful mythological units wreaking havoc, and players competing for the favor of ancient gods. The result is fantastic, fun.",
"Topatoi: The Great Tree Story is a time travel back to the days of Gods and The Lost Vikings on the Amiga System. With the innovative gyroscopic machine, the GEMMA, that Raph handles we get a great gaming experience with many interesting challenges. However, the story is too short and perhaps too easy and the arcade mode isn't fun enough to keep you playing after the game has been completed.",
"Boyfriend Dungeon is a good example of a great, unique game that’s an awesome experience in spite of its flaws. It’s by no means a perfect game. Boyfriend Dungeon has incredible character development, tackles difficult subject matter, has absolutely gorgeous artwork and a killer soundtrack, and is more than addicting enough to get you going back for more and more. And that’s in spite of the lackluster, repetitive, and limited dungeon crawling options available to you. It’s quite unlike any game I’ve ever played, in the best of ways.",
"The clunky construction interface offers no way to replace a section of track other than erasing and rebuilding every single piece that comes after it, making spontaneous adjustments a chore. [Dec 2001, p.115]",
"Yonder is a beautiful and cute game that sadly lacks almost every aspect of a good sandbox role-playing game. The quests are tedious, the farming is undercooked, and the constant gathering of resources - without a compelling combat system or a peaceful equivalent - makes for a title that is fun for about half an hour before it grinds itself into forgetfulness.",
"Rise of a Ninja, if nothing else, is undoubtedly a good foundation for something better the next time around. The graphics are fantastic, and running and jumping around the Naruto world is as convincing as it is compelling. If only the activities of this world were made of sterner stuff than rote replication of the source material's events or mind-numbing coin-collecting chores.",
"The game's short-burst quests and small-scale exploration are perfectly suited to a handheld game, and while it's easy to get into, it gets more fun and involving the more you play.",
"The game will clearly appeal more to casual gamers than to the hardcore, but it does show how the Wii U can deliver interesting games when the developers try to introduce some innovation.",
"The disappointment of flying - or driving - solo notwithstanding, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron's relentless iteration on its own design and its constantly expanding scope set it apart from other third-person shooters.",
"For a hardcore action RPG, The First Berserker Khazan doesn't lie about the goods. But, beyond a very high - and almost caricatured - difficulty, the Neople studio demonstrates very impressive know-how (especially for its first project of the genre), and this throughout the 60-70 hours that the adventure lasts. Frankly, despite a structure already seen and a slight lack on the technical and artistic direction side, it's difficult to expect more from a demanding action role-playing game. The fights are top-notch, the bosses too, there are even little ""twists"" that constantly punctuate the progression. What do you say again? Oh yes... first attempt, masterstroke!",
"A fine continuation of a successful series, but you can see that the authors are sticking to this theme longer and slowly running out of ideas. The fun is kept up by a good campaign with elements of humour and you might even try out the co-op. This time it's still enough. But the developers might not consider a fifth installment, even though it's their most successful brand, because the fatigue of the material would probably show significantly.",
"Although taking on Samurai Warriors 4: Empires head-on without any experience with past instalments may falter the depth and importance residing behind prominent characters, it’s still a solid mash-up of strategic conquering and hacking and slashing.",
"It's a short adventure, it lacks interest and it's utterly forgettable. Marvel Super Heroes deserved a much better game than this; not even kids, the main focus of the game, can enjoy this empty game with a horrible gameplay.",
"As a family game with a really low barrier of entry this game is a reasonable success. It does a great job of involving everyone in the room, as a part of the scenery if not in a starring role. Hopefully this isn't a flash in the pan and is a sign of a more healthy supply of games using the 360's previously dusty camera peripheral.",
"It is a confused mess of superfluous mechanics, confused AI, unfinished approaches and monotonous Brawler gameplay. Valkyria Revolution is well-presented and well-written, but in the end, it is just a nice package for a game that has failed at its core.",
"While less carefree than simulation titles like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, the casual pacing and nonchalant nature of the main character make Wytchwood a great pick for relaxing exploration-style games. It is also a great choice for those who enjoy crafting and survival games, but prefer to have questlines to follow instead of self-governed gameplay. While the 2D art style is fun and reminiscent of storybook illustrations, this game is likely not the best pick for younger players due to questlines dealing with horror elements, as well as graphic depictions of animal death when using traps and lures. However, fans of twisted fairytales and creepy magical plotlines will likely find Wytchwood an enjoyable and spine-tingling experience.",
"Ever Forward is a satisfying and pretty puzzle game, with a compelling narrative. However it suffers with being a bit too frustrating at times when the precision required is made difficult with clunky controls.",
"The limited playing areas and the auto targeting do detract from the gameplay, but hours could be spent simply customising your mech, let alone unlocking all of the machines that the game holds!",
"Download Alien Swarm. Do it, it's an order. It's one of the best freeware games of all times. It's fun, addictive and has great growth possibilities considering how actively the Steam community is already working on it. Thanks for the gift Valve, we love it.",
"As a whole series, Life is Strange has been an intriguing and emotional experience. The rewind mechanic is an intelligent inclusion to the interactive drama genre and gives the impression of having significant control over the narrative. That said, there's certainly an argument that player choices have all been leading to a singular binary decision which somewhat softens the finale's emotional punch.",
"Throne and Liberty presents itself as an ambitious and risky proposal to encompass a classic traditional RPG concept with new, more dynamic mechanics and top-notch visuals. The storyline is full of stereotypes, but it’s enjoyable, providing an adventure that includes a massive tutorial to cover various PvP and PvE game modes. It’s a universe to get lost in, but where modern mechanics, giving rewards too quickly, could carry the user to an end where only finds a monotony experience too soon.",
"Trek to Yomi is one of the most visually striking games to launch in a while, delivering on the promise that a samurai game can truly capture the look and feel of classic Japanese cinema. Unfortunately, good looks can only get you so far, as the gameplay and story don’t quite live up to the standards set by its art direction. But if you are in the mood for a samurai game, you could do worse than Trek to Yomi.",
An old school MMO dragged up to a modern standard. NCSoft and Amazon have a distinctly Korean fantasy adventure finessed for a global launch. The result is n enjoyable leap into a vibrant world that is more than worth the total cost of zero dollars down.,
"And that sums it up. Fuel Overdose is a game full of wrong turns. From art direction to gameplay, lacking story to lacking track design, it’s a game that never really finds its way to anything that even resembles mediocrity.",
"The Thaumaturge is a game made with a lot of love and hard work by Fool's Theory. That much is apparent within the first couple of hours and grows more obvious the longer a user plays. Its lack of a way to make searching for clues interesting may lead some players astray, but they will miss out on a demon-fueled magical adventure. It stumbles in other places, but it more than makes up for it with its monster designs and terrific storytelling. The Thaumaturge's mixture of 20th-century technology and magic should prove too fun to pass up, and players looking for a detective mystery with some intrigue and nightmares might have found something they can't find anywhere else.",
"The VR Pool at the heart of this is great, and the other games are fun to try out as well, but your fondest memories will be of pushing the game’s limits and seeing what shenanigans you can get up to.",
"The graphics are stunning, making full use of an enhanced Rogue Spear engine and the sounds are equally impressive adding to the thrilling action. The attention to detail is incredible and the tactical knowledge and training manuals are so comprehensive it can become almost like a second job.",
"But overall, I had fun with Cartoon Network Punch Time Explosion -- and if the 3DS version managed to impress me, I'm officially on watch to see what the upcoming console version of the game is going to look like.",
"Pikuniku is the perfect Sunday afternoon game; short, but sweet. It’s an enjoyable romp through a pleasant world, teaching the important life lesson that kicking things is often the simplest solution.",
"A perfect example of how the 4X strategy can be comprehensive, and yet remain clear and accessible to beginners. If you ignored the genre or it started to bore you, this is the reason to give it another chance. [Issue#274]",
"On the surface, there doesn't seem to be too much different between Rock of Ages and its sequel. Rock of Ages II plays very much the same and fills the same niche. However, it is a much nicer game with better defense items and a lot more polish. Sadly, I found that Rock of Ages II couldn't keep my attention unless I had someone else to play with.",
"Although I enjoyed my time with Part Time UFO, the later levels crossed the line from challenging to frustrating due to the physics and time limit in the game. It’s best enjoyed in short bursts of gameplay to minimize the frustration. That being said, if you like previous HAL games and physics-based puzzle games, I think you'll enjoy Part Time UFO. It's well-made and entertaining, just ultimately not my cup of tea.",
"Although it has room for improvement, the truth is that it is a pleasant surprise after last year's title. 2K pays tribute to the NBA and recovers the value of the great moments that defined its rise to the Olympus of video games.",
"Characters aside, Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a very fun game, with a frantic pace and several deviations on the main puzzle type that serve to give you a pretty full package.",
"4A Games wear its influences on its sleeve, creating a first-person shooter of robust standard. Yet it gives little consideration to progression – in both terms of furthering either the genre or its own formula. Many of the mechanics that have survived the original game return stripped back in a misguided attempt to placate complexity criticisms, rather than exploring methods that retain strategy and heighten the overall immersion.",
"While I eventually enjoyed Aporia: Beyond the Valley, the moments where bugs and glitches appeared took me right out of the experience. It’s a shame too, as the story is well told despite uttering no words at all, the premise is genuinely interesting, and the puzzles – when they work as intended – are a joy to solve. It’s certainly one to wait on for now while they tidy up all the bugs and glitches.",
The combat system is very basic and rather repetitive. The cut-scenes and story don't make a great deal of sense. The puzzle and adventure parts of the game aren't very well designed or thought through.,
"Lego City: Undercover is, like most Lego-games, a perfectly good game for all ages. Especially the older gamer will appreciate the subtle references to many games and movies, although you’ll have to consider whether the kiddy style of the game is for you. If it is, you’ll have a game that you will enjoy longer than the time you spent playing with your Lego-city, which currently resides in your attic.",
"Most of these games translate well to the Switch, the improved graphics exploding with color. Playing in 4:3 suits some games better than others, so it’s not a perfect fit. The JoyCons are a great control tool, even if a few games struggle (I’m looking at you Sky Kid, you menace) on the Switch. This was a fun little jaunt down memory lane, but it’s really nothing more than another Namco collection in new digs.",
"If you're looking for a simple SRPG that you can sink a ton of time into then Rainbow Skies is a must-buy game. On the other hand, those who want something more immediately gratifying should probably look elsewhere.",
"Takes the basic concepts of the original arcade game and adds a few gameplay elements that, ultimately, don't fit together all that well. The game plays well enough, but anyone accustomed to the simplicity of Dig Dug might turn their nose up at this one.",
Extremely fun to play with fast-paced fights and a great combo system that puts the first game to shame. This latest installment is a huge step in the right direction for the series.,
"I don't consider Sine Mora EX to be a game that sets the genre on fire, or redefines shmup gameplay in general. But it is very well-priced, looks fantastic, has replay value and is a fun and ferocious slice of old-school arcade action, one that can be enjoyed by battle-scarred veterans and eager rookies alike.",
"The Sojourn is one of the best games of the year and one of the best puzzle games available, if not the best. Every single puzzle is meticulously designed and challenges you in satisfying ways, without ever feeling impossible. Carefully crafted, beautiful levels. An uplifting, philosophical story that asks you to reflect upon your actions and the world around you. All of these ingredients create an experience like no other and a game you will be thinking about even after the credits have rolled.",
"Cute, fun, and quite literally fetching; Wytchwood blends all of its elements together wonderfully, although there is little reason to play more once you conclude the 10–12 hours’ worth of story.",
"Wattam is the Katamari successor you may not have known you needed. Keita Takahashi and the folks at Funomena have created a new kind of alternative game experience. If you long for the days when you used to collect toy figures and play sets, Wattam is a wonder to behold. It's joy, colorful and fun, in your hands and right in front of your face.",
"Having played American McGee's freaky version of ""Alice,"" the animation does not compare. However, this game has a much stronger storyline and will please both action/adventure fans and Dune fans alike.",
"For all the development trouble, for all the doubts, for all the talk about what Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance could have been – it’s now a Platinum game and it sparkles with the same confidence and verve it would have done had Kojima been at the helm. It’s an absolute joy to play and is almost certainly the best Metal Gear gen released this gen.",
"The game’s world is just gorgeous, lovingly put together, and more than that, is built to the scale of a proper MMO worth your time to try for the price of free. I can very much see Throne and Liberty finding its fans for the things it does well even if it isn’t sweepingly innovative for the genre as a whole, and that’s more than you can say for a lot of new MMOs and MMO-adjacent titles.",
"I found myself to be bewildered by the erratic actions of the artifical intelligence as opposed to being genuinely upset. If you are looking for what would happen in a truly crazy world, SuperPower 2 will let you relive that very well and leave you walking away genuinely pleased.",
"Beyond Eyes has to be commended for expressing a complicated idea so well and in such a unique way. It's almost worth experiencing just for that aspect alone. Unfortunately, as a high-concept empathy game that overrelies on the concept, it doesn't manage to move past its own cleverness.",
"Rocksteady Studios leaves Batman behind at the top of their game in terms of visual presentation, gameplay, and storytelling. While Arkham Knight's innovations are few, they are impactful and smart, and all work towards the common goal of giving the player the ultimate power fantasy of being the Batman.",
"In closing, Dark Sector has familiar gameplay to Gears of War, using the cover system, perspective and excessive bloodshed, but it's addition of abilities helps animate the darkened world.",
"Despite being a little rough around the edges, Metro: Last Light as a whole package is way better than the sum of its parts and highly recommended for anyone looking for a grown up video game.",
"Iro Hero ambitiously seeks to reinterpret polarity switching shooters. Baffling design choices render it alienating even to seasoned shoot ‘em up fans, however. The blueprint for a clever shooter is here and it’s possible the developers will rectify that base game with patches and updates, but the Iro Hero of today does not reflect that lofty potential.",
"Splatoon 2 has all the elements needed for a great sequel. It repairs some of the flaws from Splatoon while bringing new content. The new modes plus a great single player campaign will keep you playing for hours, besides, the online multiplayer works great. And yes, you can take the Squids on the go, which is just great.",
"Once you get past the (incredibly frustrating) first hour or two, earn some cash, and buy or upgrade a few cars, it's an OK combat-racing game that's hamstrung by its appalling camera and handicapped AI, and both of those sabotage any satisfaction you might actually get from the game.",
"Majora's Mask 3D is all that a remake of the original could ask for. Not only does Nintendo deliver the original's immersive plot, extremely challenging temples, multiple side-quests and the overall gloom and sorrow that surrounds the adventure, it still finds space for improvements, even at a handheld level. Let the inexperienced be warned, though: this will not go easy on the newly-arrived.",
"Framed Collection is a welcome addition to the Switch eShop. If you've ever played them before there's no real reason to play them again on the Switch as there are only minor changes. For those who haven't, it's terrific fun while it lasts but you'll probably want to play it handheld. A terrific package.",
"From a gameplay standpoint I would have been happier had they gone with a more open mission structure and something that feels a little less crushed by the weight of all the filmmaking going on. Still and all it’s well-polished, and undeniably continues the C&C legacy.",
"On one hand, the core game itself is good, and the story presented here is something you don't expect in a game. On the other hand, the technical execution of the title is so poor that one is surprised that it can run at all.",
"A triumph of raw substance over style, Legends of Eisenwald constantly wins over the heart of the RPG connoisseur despite its incompleteness thanks to its deep battle system and well crafted adventures. A great game for strategy experts.",
"The presentation is strong, and there are some genuine moments of surprise - most memorably a scene that shrinks your character down and places you on a life-sized pool table. [Feb 2004, p.109]",
"A Total War Saga: Troy feels neither like an historic game, nor like a legendary tale. It stands in between, but it's an interesting gameplay experience and a spin-off that fans should try.",
"Death flirts with mediocrity, but he's careful never to linger there too long. Darksiders II has more than a few rough edges, but they never fully run away with the experience. With a meaty quest, and hours upon hours of optional, quality stuff to do and discover, you simply can't beat Death, so you might as well join him.",
"Time Crisis: Razing Storm is pretty lame, which is sad because this franchise is the cornerstone of light-gun gaming and Sony really has the tech available to make it work. Namco really dropped the ball on this release.",
Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a very faithful remake that captures every single quality of the original title. That means you're getting a wonderful new presentation alongside all of the blemishes of the past.,
"Button City is one of those games that I really wanted to love but ended up displeased by its clunky setup and subpar mini-games. There is still a good time to be had in its cute world, though, especially if you don't mind taking the bad with the good.",
"Aesthetics, however, can only carry a game so far, and Hell Yeah! doesn't get far before it slides into drowsiness. It's a solid little platformer in many regards, but those playing need to be aware that they run the risk of growing bored and agitated by the recapitulated ideas and unsavory controls.",
"The Phantasy Reverie series also offers an Easy mode that cuts the damage you receive in half and gives you infinite lives to retry the more challenging sections of the game. Once you complete either of the games, you also gain access to a Hard mode which essentially is a ""zero hit challenge"" mode where any hit you take is lethal, and you only have one life to play with.",
"Might not offer something particularly new and exciting to the genre, but fans of Shadowrun universe will find enough here to enjoy. It’s a good tactical turn-based game, especially if you play together with other players.",
"I absolutely adore Forza Horizon 5, and while it’s possible to fault it as being a bit more of the same when compared to Forza Horizon 4, I’m not sure that’s actually a bad thing. It’s a more polished experience overall, and while it may be playing it safe just a tad, it’s hard to deny that the game is a technical marvel, and a fantastic show piece for Xbox Series X and 4K displays everywhere. Even if you opt to play in performance mode to hit that sweet 60fps spot, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how great everything looks in motion. So yes, if you’re not already convinced, do yourself a favor and check out Forza Horizon 5 when it launches this week.",
"Fuzion Frenzy 2 isn't terrible, so if you're desperate for a simple, safe party game, it fits the bill. Unfortunately, it fits the bill in so lackluster a manner, it's hard to see why they bothered.",
"If you've already completed every sudoku puzzle in ""Brain Age"" and you just can't get enough, Gridmaster is definitely easy on the wallet. But it should be your second (or even third) choice for a portable sudoku fix.",
"It's exaggerated in its look and feel, but the balance between physical realism and fantasy-tuned fun is so engaging that you begin to forget that a racing game could be fashioned any other way. [May 2003, p.68]",
"An old game in new clothing, which, fortunately, is a not a bad thing. Sure, some of the sound effects are recycled from the earliest C&C titles – send out infantry to be slaughtered and tell me I’m wrong – and it does not bring anything significantly new to the genre but is sure is fun.",
"From its flawless control and presentation, to its huge amount of variety and online modes, MCII is one of the most fun and complete racing games we've ever played. [June 2003, p.24]",
"Chamber of Time is slow-paced, looks a bit drab and it can be repetitive and awkward to play. In a way, it’s much like Akko herself. She’s far from perfect but spunky and open-hearted, making her irresistibly disarming. There’s a strong positive vibe going on that rubs on you, and it helps in overcoming the game’s shortcomings. Fans of the anime series should look no further and invest in Chamber of Time to get their little witch fix.",
"Everything about this game has it positioned to be an instant hit among fans of Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, as well as tactical RPG enthusiasts in general. Deep game play, an endearing story, likeable characters, and stunning hand-drawn backgrounds round out this experience.",
"Lego City Undercover is a joyous thing, filled with life and fun. It took me right back to my first go on the original Lego Star Wars – that pleasure of finding a favourite creative toy rendered so beautifully, faithfully and humorously into video game existence.",
"Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a great addition to the series. The fact that it’s different than the usual side-scrolling games of the series is a plus as it keeps things fresh, and the level editor gives you the creativity to make your own levels if you get tired of the one-hundred eighty plus levels the game already offers.",
"The mobile version of Part Time UFO already had the charm of a Kirby game, the physics-based chaos of World of Goo and the compelling claw machine mechanics of Nintendo Badge Arcade. This new Switch port builds on top of that already impressive stack by adding a co-op mode that betters Snipperclips and chucks in an infinite mode that provides the sort of quick-fix joy that hasn't been seen since Paper Plane on DSiWare. It may be a game about picking things up, but the real challenge will come when you try to put it down.",
"From its lively outdoor backdrops to the striking architecture found in its cities and dungeons, this PS2 title will even please--at least visually--those with next-gen FF firmly on the brain. [Nov. 2006, p.126]",
"The keyword of Age of Wonders 4 is “choice” – the game provides a lot of it, expressed in all of its mechanics. Lending itself to near unlimited replayability, especially once the ambitious plans for expansions and new content are realized, Age of Wonders 4 is a natural evolution of the series’ classic formula and will have min-maxers and role-players alike suffer from a severe bout of one-more-turn fever.",
"Forge left me with mixed feelings. It has considerable potential but until developers fulfill their promises players will have to deal with an unfinished product. [CD-Action 02/2013, p.59]",
"Despite some of the end-game content feeling designed to annoy the hell out of those who made it that far, the tally of cheap deaths can't detract from the facts: Sonic Colors is the best 3D Sonic game in ages.",
"Alwa's Legacy successfully follows its predecessor and delivers an experience that exhibits a marvelous world to look at, as well as to explore and especially, to take part in very engaging boss fights. This is a work that easily ranks with the best among its peers and that has more than earned its right to be part of many Switch owners' collections.",
"I can see the kids (the younger the better) enjoying some of the byplay between Hornball Harry and the jaguar, but if they manage to get that far with the awkward controls and loopy camera, then they&#146;re pretty strong gamers for their age. Skip this one.",
"Not only does Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 cure insomnia, but it improves your social skills as you will need to go out and find friends to replace the ones that don’t want to speak to you again after you force this one them.",
"Despite its rather brief runtime, Mini Motorways shows what made the game so successful on mobile platforms. Featuring a gameplay loop that's hard to resist, the only thing holding it back is a lack of true variety. Luckily, when the gratification loop is this intoxicating and the price is so minimal, the limited replay value can be easily forgiven.",
"If you're hoping for something epic or monumental (like, for example, MGS4 or Mass Effect; two games that still managed to blow my insanely high expectations out of the water), you may be slightly disappointed. That said, it's important to note that the only reason I'm saying this is to keep your standards in check - Gears 2 is by all measure a must-have title for the Xbox 360.",
"Fall of Cybertron feels like an actual love letter to the series, and puts the right amount of emphasis on individual characters and their traits and mixes that with levels that make use of those particular skills and abilities. It's just a real joy to play, and I'm glad to have in my hands an actual, fun Transformers experience in video game form.",
"If your young one really wants to play a mystery-solving game, get them Hotel Dusk or one of the Phoenix Wright games, which actually involve some problem-solving. If, however, your kid is a die-hard Nancy Drew fan, just get them one of the books – it’s cheaper and you don’t have to put up with shallow, boring gameplay to get to the story.",
"Story Mode is utterly boring and Survival Mode plods along with room after room of lifeless challenges. Online play through the Wi-Fi Connection is also here, but isn't worth the time.",
"I am still heavily invested in the story of Batman: The Enemy Within, and I’m excited to see how things develop from here. But little niggles like inconsequential ‘big’ decisions still feel too heavy-handed and put into the story for a bit of shock value that doesn’t really amount to much in the end.",
"Guardian Heroes isn't a long ride, but it's one worth taking. If you owned a Sega Saturn, this will bring back memories. If you're a newcomer, now you'll know what we saw in the system back in 1996.",
"Dig Dug Digging Strike took everything that I loved about Dig Dug and made it better. I haven’t been this impressed with a make-over of a classic game since Sega released ""OutRun 2"" last year.",
"A game that conveys in a very fascinating way the principles of magical thinking, folk horror and hauntology connected to the Italian rural tradition thanks to an awesome artistic work. Gameplaywise, though, Saturnalia struggles to offer solid survival horror mechanics and the roguelite elements are quite shallow, while the core of the narrative adventure is nonetheless gripping and interesting.",
"With not much of value in the narrative or the gameplay, Forgotten Fields’ merits are some pretty virtual environments and an original soundtrack that often takes the spotlight. There are ways in which Forgotten Fields could have worked as an emotionally powerful experience, but these avenues go under-explored and the result is something that I can’t recommend, even to enthusiasts of this particular genre-transcending premise.",
"This game comes with loads of great fan service, including a full voiced cast. Sadly, when you look at it as a hack and slash action game, the game has little depth. Still, if you can live with average gameplay there is plenty to enjoy here.",
"What it does do is take the simple, tactile pleasure of solidly built FPS action and inject it into such a staggeringly wide variety of situations, contexts and scenarios that putting down the pad after a heavy blasting session is genuinely difficult.",
"Between the tedious levels, incoherent story and offputting gigolo missions, I found very little to appreciate about Killer is Dead. I grew quite tired of the shallow game design and weak attempts to distract me from its vacuous lack of substance, and put the game down before rolling credits.",
"For all the pros and cons of this type of game, Sim City 2000 has the stamp of quality. It is very well presented graphically although it doesn't have quite the feel of a bustling city the PC version has.",
"There are technical cracks in its brickwork, but in combining the familiar constructs of the LEGO video games with an original story, huge amounts of humour and a ridiculous number of things to collect or discover, LEGO City Undercover proves that LEGO titles can be blockbusters without a big licence.",
"The frustrating moments in Ridge Racer Unbounded are far outweighed by the deeply satisfying ones. It's anarchic, well designed, thrilling to behold and will put a massive grin on any true petrol-head's face.",
"Dead Cells is one of the most interesting indie games ever made. Even though some of its roguelike elements may not have worked out for the best, this is a well executed game with one of the most fun combat systems of the year, thanks to its involving gameplay cycle and to a very fun and fluid combat system.",
"The second entry in the remake trilogy is so good that it left us wondering: “how are they going to make something better for the final episode?” Narrative, gameplay, content… everything is at the highest level, and it managed to keep us engaged, interested in the story and having fun for more than 100 hours.",
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Tape 1 plants the seeds to yet another excellent teen drama and mystery by Don’t Nod: authentic, fun, intimate and intriguing, the title naturally navigates complex themes and teenage conversations, showing the studio's tremendous evolution. If things remain this way on Tape 2, we will definitely have a new classic of the adventure genre in our hands.",
"There’s a decent amount of content in Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue, but it doesn’t explain much for newcomers playing their first Kingdom Hearts game on the PS4. In addition, Back Cover will feel like a waste of time to some, and Birth by Sleep will feel too short. Dream Drop Distance translates fairly well, but alone it’s not worth the price of admission. As a bundle, the entire package offers a decent value and a great lead-in to Kingdom Hearts III.",
"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is innovative, features unique gameplay and is always between cheerful, funny and challenging at times. It's sometimes a bit limited and linear, but for one go, it's great.",
"This game has a lot of potential and with another year of development could have been a great game for someone of any age. What we’re left with is a boring, stale, tedious shell of a game that simply won’t appeal to anyone.",
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos really is a blast to play both alone and with friends. The world is exciting to explore, and players never know what is going to be tucked away in some random corner for them to discover. Sadly, in its current state there are so many issues that manage to bring the whole experience down very quickly. Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos needs to have many of its problems fixed before it will be accessible to the greater video game community.",
"A damn fine game. Those that are looking for some huge new thing will probably be disappointed, but Relic was never going for the next evolution, they were just looking to make the formula a bit better, and certainly succeeded.",
"It’s a very solid remaster of a classic game, and those looking for a nostalgia trip to 20 years ago should look no further. Some of the quirks are still present, even the original cheats, ultimately making this the true Definitive Edition.",
"Ever Forward isn’t an easy road, but whatever you make of its final narrative revelation, it’s an engaging, rewarding journey that’s well worth taking. Just remember to stop scratching your head when you hit brain matter.",
"The narrative is over the top in its environmentalist messages that are laid out in text form and hit you over the head like a frying pan. The soundtrack doesn't quite know its place, and the art is passing, but fails when there's nothing to look at but the backgrounds. These sorts of things interrupt the tone, but in situations where the game's parts all work together - which is most of the time - The Aquatic Adventures of the Last Human is a subtle and solemn exploration of a new, but old world.",
"Obviously, there are some people that probably won’t enjoy Yonder too much. If you want action and adventure, of course, it’ll probably bore you, and if you want a fast-paced story, you’re not going to find that here. But if you’re just looking for a delightful game that allows you to explore to your heart’s contest, Yonder is exactly what you’re looking for.",
"AC Liberation HD lacks the production values the series used us to, and even if it's a Live Arcade release it results in a weak experience, with a badly narrated story and the complete omission of the multiplayer component, present in the original version. Ubisoft did a good HD porting job, but it's hardly an unmissable game.",
"Lumines: Electronic Symphony is the best Lumines yet, the music is incredible, the new modes and features are a nice touch, and it looks gorgeous and vibrant on the Vita's OLED screen (a theme among all Vita games, it seems). It's a must have for anyone who enjoyed it on the PSP (or on any platform), and I couldn't recommend it more highly as a PlayStation Vita launch title. You can't go wrong with this purchase.",
"The story continues to get better and better with each step. Since it was written by the same people who did the Ace Attorney games, I'm not surprised at the quality of these games. Unfortunately, when it ends, the game is pretty much over since it is linear and doesn't have any alternative endings.",
"With both this expansion and its predecessor, Heroes IV expansions only give you more of the same... and charge you $30 for the pleasure. Does that make this a bad game? No, it doesn't, but it is a bad expansion.",
"Gameplay-wise Kill Team is as simple as they come, but there's something mysteriously addictive and enjoyable in slaughtering thousands of space orks and having a few beers on the side. The different characters and combinations offer even some replayability value. [Jan 2012]",
"It's nice that many games include achievements and support online multiplayer and leaderboards, but if you're not having much fun with the games, what's the point? Atari Flashback Classics would have been a stronger collection if it had fewer games and more effort could have been put into making them play as well as the originals. As it stands, though, this collection is strictly for the hardcore gaming classicist.",
"As it stands, however, it is a project that puts the long testing phase it desperately needs behind the payment of an entrance fee, among other things in an undergrowth in which the competition has adopted the free-to-play model for years, running the risk of generating a fall from which it seems difficult to recover.",
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition perfects and fine-tunes one of the most venerated RPGs of the last decade. While the English voice acting and the occasional resolution dip is disappointing, they made such a meaningless difference that it didn't matter in the end. The gorgeous visual upgrade, the wide and varied locations, the deeply entertaining battle system, and the exquisite soundtrack all add together to one of the best RPG experiences possible.",
The endearing characters and witty dialogue are real winners. It’s professionally done in places and anyone looking to dabble in a lighthearted adventure will find this a stimulating experience; just don’t expect to be playing for months.,
"A solid dungeon hack, but after four years of the same, the formula is wearing a bit thin. Return to Arm’s biggest failure is that it feels too much like an expansion pack instead of a shiny, brand new game.",
The visuals and sharp and well animated but unlike many games aimed at the mass market the characters don't seem very cool or quirky. The Mario cast has been thrown into too many products for their appearance to hold much sway with this gamer.,
"Elsweyr is another great chapter for The Elder Scrolls Online. It doesn’t include anything revolutionary, but with the new Necromancer and the Elsweyr map it’s more than enough to keep ESO’s fans entertained for more than a dozen hours.",
"Yeah, the game is really long, but is there any variety or challenge? Not really. And, if you're not sick of playing by the end of just a couple of these annoyingly long levels, I admire your patience.",
"One of the best DS games of 2008. Combining the addictive, strategic fun of Tower Defense with an excellent tale spanning over 20 hours, brilliant animation and easy to learn controls, it should secure its place in the hearts of gamers everywhere.",
"A great storyline, excellent delivery, top-notch voice acting and fun, varied gameplay help Jak II continue Naughty Dog’s tradition of high quality games. It’s simply not to be missed.",
"Raving Rabbids Alive & Kicking is truly the best party game you can get for Kinect. With forty different mini-games, you will keep on playing with your friends. Unfortunately there are some crappy games, but the fun ones have the majority.",
"With its novel approach to combat, a charming little art style, and plenty of unique mechanics, Dicefolk is a game with plenty of personality, and plenty of reasons to keep rolling its die, and coming back for more.",
"The long loading times, clumsy controls and bland presentation make Rabbids: Alive and Kicking a disappointment of old Rabbids fans. However, the minigames are fun and the four-player modes help a lot. If you're looking for a Kinect game that doesn't involve fitness or dancing this may be worth your while.",
"Endless Space 2 is probably the best videogame ever created by Amplitude Studios, a 4X strategic game with an incredible personality, a deep (and unusual, for this type of productions) storyline, and an almost flawless gameplay. A real gem.",
"An exceptional title in every way. It has all the elements you need for a potential classic; massive production values, jaw-dropping visuals and sound, intricate and engaging storyline, fast-paced and immersive gameplay.",
"The success of the original Myst has inspired hundreds of similar games, and Myst V is better than almost all of them, yet its failure to achieve the heights of its predecessors left me feeling disappointed.",
"Mystery Mayhem is filled with such touches that you can't help but smile at, at least for a little while until you realise that behind the pretty visuals, charming animation and spot-on spot effects lies something too innocent and simplistic to be of interest to anyone other than the very young or woefully misguided.",
"The Driver franchise isn't quite ready for a bullet in the head, but it's definitely tired. Atari needs to let the series take some time off until there's a compelling non-financial reason to produce another installment, and Reflections should do some soul-searching to figure out which parts of the game work.",
"The Settlers: New Allies isn't quite the return to Settlers that fans of the franchise would want. Shallow across all areas, with basic city-building and very basic strategy elements, held together by an average narrative. It's not a bad game, but it's also not good.",
"The game is ultimately too stripped-down and simplistic to warrant a higher score; a more engaging surface world, compelling storyline and ambitious gameplay would have driven the final tally up considerably.",
"Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time represents the show it is based on incredibly well when it comes to the look and the characters. That’s all it gets right, though, as the gameplay is just frustrating and tedious.",
"The player guild experience is the Shadowbane experience. Get involved with a good one and depth of gameplay becomes clear. Get involved with a bad one and you'll never get past the same old monster farming you've seen before. [July 2003, p.68]",
"While it doesn't re-invent the wheel, Forza Motorsport pretty much perfects it. Its user-friendly options make it great for casual drivers and its generous reward system honors the skill of the experienced racer.",
"Close to the Sun is one of the best examples of the “walking simulator” style of adventure game I’ve seen in quite some time. It does a wonderful job of blending the visual style of BioShock with the tense atmosphere of Outlast and slow-paced world-building of Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. While the sometimes-obtuse puzzles and slow pacing can cause frustration and repetition, this is a harrowing and thoughtfully designed adventure from start to finish.",
"Kingdom Hearts 2.8 is thoroughly enjoyable, even as a newcomer, but it requires a lot of homework via YouTube clips and Wiki. The characters are varied and vibrant, and the lineup includes some classic headliners. It's a great taste of what's to come in Kingdom Hearts III, but I feel it's priced a bit high for what it delivers.",
"The game remains as excellent as ever, and at $19.99 the price is definitely right. While it's not for seasoned vets, Lumines Plus should be a great buy for folks who are wondering what the excitement's all about.",
"I definitely had fun with Onimusha: Warlords, despite many of its mechanics and visuals aging poorly since 2001. A lot of my enjoyment comes from revisiting an old favorite, but there's not enough new stuff here to recommend this to someone new to the series. The save system, terrible animations, and unskippable cutscenes just don't work in the modern era. It's a shame, because Onimusha is one of my favorite PS2 games, and just a few tweaks to some of the older systems would have helped enormously. The modern release is exactly how I remember it, and unfortunately in 2019, that's just not good enough.",
"It's a hand-wringing, apologetic shooter that offers great gunplay alongside more peaceful options. Last Light has every opportunity to be bloated and inconsistent, but it never succumbs to the pressure of its own expectations — and that's worth tolerating a few frustrating technical hiccups.",
"Biomotor Unitron does a more than admirable job of living up to my childhood dreams. The game is pure fun, unique in the face of its inspirations, easy on the eyes, and surprisingly snappy. After finishing the game, despite accomplishing everything and developing every part I could, I immediately started a new game with a different character. This was partially to check out the other Unitron designs, but mostly because I had such a good time. Biomotor Unitron might seem daunting at first, but keep in mind the port is packaged with a virtual manual that is useful for deciphering its intricacies. If any part of this game draws your curiosity, I highly recommend giving it a shot. At its low price point, you are unlikely to be disappointed.",
"Strangely compelling. The character, however underdeveloped he might be in this particular interpretation of the fiction, is enough to justify playing through what is otherwise a distinctly mediocre action title.",
"Still, Hollywood likes things that go boom and look good doing so, much like Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The game industry operates much the same way, but the best games within it also introduce a fresh experience, something Transformers: Fall of Cybertron fails to do. Yes, Grimlock and the Combaticons are new, but for all practical purposes they're just multimedia window dressing on an otherwise evolutionary, not revolutionary, title.",
"Everything that made the first one memorable is expanded upon ten fold! It has an engrossing storyline, breath taking graphics, and a wonderful music score. This game is not to be missed!",
"Sonic Colours is Sega's first step in the right direction towards making a great Sonic game, but they're not quite there yet. This isn't the second coming of Sonic, but it's fun enough for kids and fans of the series.",
"Everspace is an addictive space rouge-like shooter that doesn‘t punish the ship destruction too cruelly. In addition to entertaining gameplay, it offers a beautifully created universe where it is a pleasure to fly in any spare moment you have.",
"It would've been great to have multiple people battling the dark simultaneously, but this is the next best thing, very competitive and lots of fun. And with different weapons to upgrade to, it just keeps on going.",
The RPG elements and advanced combo system immerse players into the game - letting them make Death into their own unique killing machine. Improved NPC interactions and side quests make this larger world feel not so bland and desolate. Darksiders II outshines its predecessor in almost every aspect.,
"While lacking the sheer depth of either ""Virtua Fighter"" or ""Soul Calibur,"" DOA's fighting system offers the fastest 3D fighting around with a slick reversal system tuned for players of all abilities. [Oct 2004, p.108]",
"A much better title than its original, and even though we got through it, we have already begun our second round to build up our characters and unlock all the goodies the game has to offer.",
"The action is faithful to the goofy fighting found in the Army of Darkness movie and the game is available for a value price. All this being said, there is an obvious lack of polish and depth, and it won't last more than a few days.",
"Although the game has many and evident flaws, especially in its visuals, and it is not revolutionary, nor it differentiates itself from the rest of action and RPG games, it indeed is engaging and makes you keep playing thanks to its freedom.",
"After their magnificent debut in the form of Mini Metro, Dinosaur Polo Club managed to accomplish something extremely difficult - clear their own raised bar. Mini Motorways is a better game in every department, more beautiful, more relaxing, more complex.",
"Bigger, better, less reliant on established formulas, but manages to feel like a totally natural follow-up to the 2010 original. And it's exactly the game it should be, too. It's not War's chaotic, tightly-packed adventure. It's a lonelier, more barren trek through dead lands.",
"The game looks good and the controls are not hard to understand, but this is another in a long line of games that are riding the crest of the feature film and not offering anything compelling enough to maintain interest for long.",
"I think I just have unfortunately played too many other visual novels that tackle what this game set out to do that some of the reveals just didn’t work for me. Many of them do though, and it can be quite emotional and thrilling most of the time. It was nice to finally give Root Double the attention it deserved, even if it took me buying it on two other platforms first. If you enjoy science-themed mystery stories, you should definitely check out Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition.",
"If your looking for a game that redefines the football genre year after year, go with NFL 2K3. If you want a game that is the same every year, and offers nothing new, then go with Madden.",
"Overall, however, we can only be satisfied with the outcome of the nostalgia operation implemented by Blizzard, which will once again trap fans in an endless cycle of fights to the death and unbridled looting.",
"Let's just say it: Hotline Miami isn't for everyone. It's brutal, bloody and extraordinarily unforgiving. Thanks to Hotline Miami, the 8-bit top-down shooter genre gets put in the spotlight again after Retro City Rampage. It deserves the attention. Well, if you can stomach countless retries and a dozen smashed skulls.",
"The Sexy Brutale is a game I can happily recommend to just about anyone. The well-crafted environment, appealing music, and enthralling characters should appeal to virtually everyone who enjoys a good plot-driven game, and the overall mystery leads to a satisfyingly heartfelt conclusion. I reached that point in about eight hours’ time, though I dilly-dallied quite a lot on the way in order to leave no stone unturned, so seasoned adventurers will certainly be able to finish it even sooner. The lack of challenge may turn some people off, but surely only the most diehard puzzle fanatics. The simple fact is that it’s hard not to have a good time voyeuristically exploring this strange mansion and piecing together all the information you can find to save the lives of your masked cohorts. It’s a blast to do again and again, which is good because that’s what The Sexy Brutale continually invites you to do.",
"Punch Time Explosion is not a trendsetter; that's for certain. But with no portable Super Smash Bros. in sight, it's a likeable interpretation that will curb your cravings--or start them anew. [May 2011, p.89]",
"Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is still lumbered with some of the quirks of its ‘90s origins. This is understandable - it is a remaster, not a remake - but those quirks do cause some friction. Beneath them, though, the underlying gameplay remains as solid as a fully upgraded phalanx. Indeed, some of its ideas are almost as fresh today as they were 20 years ago, which says something rather damning about the genre as a whole. The game also looks and sounds terrific, and fans of the original will be delighted.",
"Immortals Fenyx Rising's Myths of the Eastern Realm DLC is a noble effort by Ubisoft Chengdu to infuse new and rarely touched upon mythology into the mainstream of games. Though mainly a reskin of the base game, fans should enjoy this godly romp.",
"The variety of maps, tasks and challenges is one of the strong suits of Part Time UFO. Even though the gameplay mechanics are pretty simple, clever puzzle design keeps the player entertained for many hours. [Issue#251, p.71]",
"Harmonix Music VR is a half-hearted compilation of four tech demos that are interesting for less than a minute apiece. With so many other things to try on PSVR for a similar price, you’ll feel short-changed if you waste your money on this.",
"Whether or not a player will like this game depends primarily on how they take to the humor, which is offbeat and playful, as well as his or her willingness to look beyond the game's lack of cohesive story.",
"Hellbound is based around recreating the classic first-person shooter game experience of the 90s, which it does succeed in doing. If you were a fan of those games or wanted to experience what they were like in a modern package, then the developers at Saibot Studios have delivered, for the most part. Unfortunately, the game falls short of a great experience.",
"After Us wants to comment on the dark side of consumerism, but it fails to convey its message through mediocre gameplay. Neither the story or the mechanics are satisfying enough, there are technical issues and the action feels superfluous.",
"This is the second time in a month that I’ve been completely bowled over by an indie project that I’d never even heard of, created by people whose games I’ve never played. I can think of no better indicators that no matter how bad SimCity turned out, no matter how disappointing the gameplay in Bioshock Infinite, no matter how familiar any Call of Duty, no matter whether the next Xbox is always online, it’s a perfect time to be into videogames.",
"The graphics are as beautiful as ever, the presentation is immaculate, the story keeps you gripped and your brain will appreciate the workout before you go back to killing it with beer, cheesy Wotsits and Hollyoaks. [PC Zone]",
"If you loved DmC, you really can't go wrong here. But if it wasn't everything you had hoped for, Vergil's Downfall will do little than give you a glimpse into the stylish Devil May Cry of old, at least from an aesthetic perspective.",
"A fantastic addition to the XBLA catalog of remakes. While the remix graphics don't benefit the game, and the gameplay flow shows its age, Guardian Heroes remains a classic in the hack and slash genre.",
"The complete package; its diversity in both the build up to the race and on the road delivers an experience that satisfies on multiple levels, making for an effective racing game. Unlike other games of the same genre, this one will test your brain, memory as well as your reflexes.",
"The team at Dinosaur Polo Club clearly has a knack for creating stripped-down but beautiful graphics and for simplifying mechanics down to their essence, which is a clear strength for a title that aims for success on mobile devices. But in order to make Mini Motorways engaging on other platforms, they needed to introduce a new mechanic or a new way to tackle the traffic challenge to add to the depth of the experience.",
Darksiders 2 is not perfect but a really good game. The beautiful design and the new hero are truly entertaining. A lot of RPG elements mean one step forward for the Darksiders series. Some levels in the game were unnecessarily drawn out but the rest of the game is brilliant.,
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos is a game that I didn’t expect to love as much as I did. With an in-depth upgrade system and the perfect mix of adventure and rogue-lite elements, fans of those genres will find themselves at home here.",
"Interesting and direct, this game offers an intense management experience trying to make the Police Department work and also to discover the main character's past; it's also a little repetitive from the first release... and that is not sexy.",
"The $30 price tag might scare away a few people, but there's no denying that Namco Museum is a bundle of fun. Just about every game is a classic, and while the overall collection could stand to be bigger, the fact that three games are new to the series shows that there's hope for some newer titles in the future, as opposed to the same library of classics. If you're a fan of retro gaming, Namco Museum is an easy purchase to make.",
"Bright, bold, and loud is the Metronomicon, and though it has a namesake broiled in evil, the game is pure, unfiltered goodness. A dance step game that is also a RPG battler, the game keeps you active, keeps you thinking, and loosens some of the stagnation for both genres by throwing them into a blender together. A grand concoction, The Metronomicon is a must have for any gamer.",
"I'll admit it might be a tough pill to swallow in regards to picking up this game for a third time, but having it in a portable form that's nearly identical to the home console versions is certainly a pretty big plus. Ideally this is for the hardcore fan, or the person who held off buying Ultimate the first time around because they didn't want another version of the game 9 months after the last one released. If you fall into either of these camps, then you should definitely pick this one up. I don't think there's enough here to really blow away any casual fan, but it's certainly worth a look and right up there with BlazBlue as a pretty awesome launch title for fighting game fans.",
Neon White’s chaotic presentation and somewhat puerile script conceals a game of taut design and striking imagination – a delicious test of skills that generously rewards commitment with exhilaration.,
"Forced Showdown is an action RPG Roguelike where you have to fight for your life in a sequence of arenas. Going forward will let you face enemies each time stronger and merciless. Cards are the way: they will give you more juice, power and support abilities to survive longer. Luck is also essential to win all the battles till the end. If you like hard challenges this game is for you.",
"If you’ve enjoyed No More Heroes and some of Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture’s other releases, you should definitely consider experiencing The Silver Case 2425, with its memorable narrative and excellent music, despite the technical issues on Nintendo Switch.",
"It's passable, all the way through. The matches are okay in terms of entertainment value, the game feel is okay and the developers have done a decent job of building their own hero party based on the fact that Blizzard is behind, but there is also a lack of intrinsic value here and given that they have borrowed so freely from Paladins, Overwatch and even Lawbreakers and thus failed to build their own identity, there is no reason for me to continue playing - when I can continue to enjoy the originals instead.",
"A poor man’s version of Sid Meier’s Pirates, and seeing as the other game is probably on a budget label by now, or at least in a bargain bin somewhere, then it’s clear that this won’t even appeal to those who want some story with their pirating.",
"Thanks to the strong attention to detail, the world of Ivalice feels less like a video game and more like an actual place. Not only are the actions and motivations of the various characters believable, but the characters themselves are often quite memorable to boot.",
"Although nothing special or notable for original ideas, this is how a licensed game should be done. If you&#146;re a fan, God-forbid, you might just like it. Kudos to Artificial Mind & Motion.",
"But this game property advancement isn't nearly as creative as Namco's other classic DS remakes, and its old-school presentation comes off more sloppy and lazy than it does clever.",
"Some stealth games end up solely being about moving from one shadow to another, but Monaco has a good balance between fast paced action and careful planning. That’s what makes it successful in the end, despite its – at times – confusing and cluttered visuals.",
"It's disappointing to find that a game so reliant upon riding earthy mounds, avoiding rocks and leaping chasms leaves the player feeling disassociated from the environments. For all the sensory feedback you could as well be controlling a futuristic hoverboard. [Oct 2003, p.102]",
"It’s another year, another pretty mixed bag, even if it does feel like things might be trending in a slightly more positive direction. Here’s the thing though, like those Seahawks, things’ll only keep running in place unless Madden can offer some more meaningful change going forwards. Here’s hoping having the series’ cheeky sibling back on the block, with its marching bands and moral quandaries about exploitation, can help spur that shift.",
"With the Dead Kings DLC, Ubisoft has done a good job adding interesting mechanics and ideas to the original (and quite boring) Unity’s gameplay. Despite the lack of an interesting story, this DLC is entertaining thanks to the different peace granted by the Catacombs, with their nice puzzles. It’s a free DLC. Just enjoy it, and have fun.",
"No, you won't find volumes of content or progressive new ideas, and the forced touchscreen controls are a minor strategic bungle. However, the well-paced single-player campaign is punctuated by a strong and varied weapon set and online multiplayer that hits an unprecedented level of quality for a handheld.",
"There’s clearly potential here, but these games will never be more than easily discarded novelties until the developer’s fine tune the controls and embrace the creative craziness of Dream Matches. Here’s hoping Mario and Sonic bring their A game next time around.",
"Loop Hero is a dense and dangerous journey that puts you in full control, merging deck building and the rogue-like genre brilliantly. With tons of options to choose from, and lots of surprises along the way, it would be a mistake to miss out on Four Quarters' wonderful indie title.",
"An action story using a pirate ship as a storytelling vessel. While the action part is quite enjoyable, the game lacks the necessary depth in mechanisms to enrich its gameplay and deliver that special something that would increase its replay value and make it last in time.",
"Lego City Undercover is a surprise you don't want to miss. Smart use of the GamePad, a colorful sandbox world teeming with things to do and a clever, humorous story make this one of the best reasons to own a Wii U.",
"Splatoon 2 has taken everything from the original and amped it all up to eleven. There’s no lollygagging with this sequel; online modes and gear are robust right out of the gate, with the promise of even more to come. New additions like Salmon Run expound upon an already winning formula and offer veteran players further reason to give the title a try. It also can’t be ignored that the boon of being able to pick up and play the game anywhere is something that is only possible with Switch. While I do feel that chat is needlessly cumbersome, it’s fairly easy to start matches with friends, and I never experienced any hitches while battling online. Splatoon 2 is a brilliant and rare game that manages to outshine its predecessor, and is yet another reason to own a Switch.",
"Get ready for 10 more years of nonsense and trickery. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 truly showcases the Vita's power, packing every last mode and feature from the PS3 version into the palm of your hand. No rookie or veteran fight fan should miss it.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a competent soulslike, featuring a unique universe full of personality. It hits the nail on the head with the core mechanics of a game of this genre, featuring brutal and dynamic battles that manage to maintain that much desired fine line between sharp difficulty and fun. Although a little more innovation and variety could elevate the title to unmissable status, it is undeniable that we have here a great action RPG, especially for fans of the genre.",
"Naughty Dog's expansion of Jak and Daxter's world to include different forms of gameplay has been seamless, and should open up their adventures to those who find the very concept of platform games anathema.",
"After Us succeeds in delivering a unique and stylish platform experience. While the mechanics are simple, you are challenged to use them in different ways throughout the 12 hour(ish) experience, although sometimes depth perception may cause an aggravating amount of falls. Personally, the story was interesting but lacked the depth needed to feel the emotions which were conveyed on screen. This being said, After Us is a visually stunning game, containing a variety of interesting art designs being followed by the soothing, sometimes eerie soundtrack.",
"Not the most original title for a game, but do not let that fool you. This boxing game already appeared on iOS devices with a cheaper price tag, but the Vita version looks much sharper. Too bad the touch screen controls are a bit of a letdown. [October 2013 p.94]",
"As much as I wish I could dive into Rage now, the story’s second and final part, Don’t Nod is very clever in holding the instalment back. Its lack of availability only proves that the studio has achieved what it set out to do as I’ve not been able to stop theorising about what may happen next. Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a modern classic. Tape one, Bloom, proves that this is the evolution that the episodic adventure genre needed, replacing player passivity with a clear sense of agency and involvement. When all that is backed by an intriguing story, well-written characters, and an infusion of 90s nostalgia, well, you end up with something very special indeed.",
"Omen of Sorrow offers a lot of modes, unlocks, characters, and some decent fighting elements, but it doesn’t quite have the polish or draw to keep me invested. For genre fans, though, it’s worth checking into.",
"The controls - based on the gyroscope in your phone - don't always work as well as they should, keeping Melbits World from earning a higher score. If you can get past that, however, you'll get a co-operative puzzle experience that will keep the entire family playing for a long time to come.",
"When the really similar levels and waves of opponents get too repetitive towards the end of the game, Dark Sector's weak storyline might not be enough to carry the more fickle fan to the finish line...It's fun, but it's not perfect.",
"Nintendo has implemented new play mechanics, added fantastic new character-specific weapons, and thrown in some amazing new tracks to make Mario Kart: Double Dash!! the best multiplayer experience currently available on the GameCube.",
"The game looks great and the combat system is fantastic but the urge to 'improve on FF XIII' resulted in a step backwards for the franchise. The distinctive feel of the previous game is gone. [March 2012, p.66]",
Trek could have stayed entirely in the land of the living and still be a surprise hit of a game. It’s gone well beyond that though and cemented its place as one of the greats. The side-scrolling genre has become a place for artful indies to exist but it’s been a while since a game like Trek made gamers take notice; and they definitely should.,
"Shovel Knight Showdown truly delivers a genuine 4 players brawl action, in the famous and recognizable Shovel Knight fashion. If you like fighting games that are easy to learn but hard to master, this might be your shovel of tea. Cup I mean.",
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage - Tape 1 presents a heartfelt look at girlhood in all its flaws and triumphs. As only half of the full picture, Tape 1 can feel slow and lacking in payoff, but it’s still an intriguing journey with lovable characters, reactive choices, and some phenomenal needle drops. It’s flawed in a lot of ways, particularly with regards to performance on PS5, but its heart shines through.",
"Metro: Last Light isn't just another AAA shooter aimed at a typical gamer. The game's strength lies in its mature, brutal content - and I don't mean just the story (that will get its own book soon). Metro has a ton of amazing little details that make this virtual world seem very real. And what's more - the game is absolutely beautiful. Taking all this into consideration, there can be only one verdict: must buy.",
"King of Seas is an engaging, challenging RPG open-world game. Progressing through the story is rewarding thanks to the influence player choices have on enemy encounters and world exploration. With a few changes to the controls and the introduction of more intuitive world maps, King of Seas could offer fans of pirate narratives or open-world exploration style RPG games a replayable and immersive gaming experience.",
"A game that every motorcycling lover should at least try; some small problems can somewhat undermine part of the gameplay experience, but the feelings it transmits while racing are among the best in gaming. If you love motorbike races and you're willing to forgive some frame-rate drops and other small graphical problems, you should consider it.",
"Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem just isn&#146;t much fun. Blame it on its repetitive nature, the bad level design, the lame gameplay mechanics, the poor controls, or the collection mentality that composes a large part of the game &#150; blame it on something because there&#146;s no denying that Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem is a huge bore-fest.",
Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! marks a great return for the iconic series. It may take a few missteps with some minor gameplay elements but what's here still provides a superb collection of bubble-bursting fun that you can easily enjoy with friends.,
"Still, overall it offers an enjoyable plot combined with a good battle system and interesting characters, making this latest Mega Man game a welcome addition to the saga not just for fans, but also for those wanting their first taste of the Blue Bomber.",
"As stated before, portable Dynasty Warriors fans who have wanted to be able to play with their friends will be extremely satisfied with what Strikeforce offers and will be able to overlook the obvious deficiencies. While it might work for fans, new people looking and hoping that this would be the perfect title to jump into the series will be utterly disappointed.",
"And that's what South of Midnight is: an unapologetic love letter to the American Deep South; specifically, the gothic vibes that permeate the mythology and superstitions of the region as well as the history and culture of the people who live there. It doesn't exactly wow with its combat and platforming, but these parts of the game are mechanically sound, and South of Midnight's memorable characters, incredible visuals, and catchy soundtrack are so strong that it doesn't really matter that the gameplay is just decent. South of Midnight is the type of story that will sit with you, and a good reminder that we need more games about the American Deep South. Compulsion Games hasn't made a direct sequel to any of its games yet, but it needs to make an exception here--I am not done with this world.",
"Not only is Hotline a shoe-in for Indie of the Year, it represents a masterful, artistic achievement that generates equal parts frustration, enjoyment and addiction, and therefore comes highly recommended.",
"Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide seems like an eerie, well-done Left 4 Dead mod on the surface. But players that soldier through disheartening dice rolls will find a replacement for their co-op and loot-driven needs, Warhammer fan or not.",
"Diablo 2 Resurrected has a stunning graphical overhaul as well as satisfactory controller support, but it's really not a remaster for the masses: it's primarily aimed at fans of the original title. Nostalgia won't necessarily be enough to make you forget the lack of modernization of many interface or gameplay elements. So it struggles to compete with the many newer games in the same genre on many levels. Let's hope for more changes in the future. Even if it doesn't impose itself as a modern title, we still recommend it to players looking to discover this great classic in good conditions, knowing that it offers an almost unlimited life span to those who are hooked on its old formula.",
"Vast improvements have been made to tighten up the gameplay in all the areas it needed most, and the results make this the most accessible and fun football game I've ever played; and I've played them all.",
"One of those games that keeps you coming back to finish it despite it&#146;s simplistic gameplay, due mostly to clever puzzle design. It uses a simple formula that provides straightforward action and adventure elements in a spooky, but kid-friendly setting.",
"Old-schoolers who cut their teeth on the original Bros. have a lot to enjoy in Super Princess Peach, while new players will find an excellent and challenging introduction into one of gaming's most venerable and popular genres.",
"Even though NASCAR Kart Racing may not be the most innovative racer on the market, that shouldn’t turn you away. The game is an unabashed ""Mario Kart"" clone that, while not looking nearly as good, plays almost exactly the same.",
"Knights and Bikes is a charming adventure, particularly enjoyable in coop. We’ve had a good time with it, but there isn’t much depth, challenge or innovation so, at the end of the day, you’ll want to play it for its charm.",
"Superhot’s standalone expansion Mind Control Delete is a great example of how to achieve growth, drive your franchise forward and prevent an admittedly pretty basic concept from going stale. Before I knew I was ready for a change, Superhot Team thrust age-old video game tropes into gaming’s most unique shooter in ways only they could and, in a crazy twist, it works.",
"RPG Makers Fes fails at moving the PC version of the program to Nintendo 3DS. The lack of any tutorial, or information whatsoever, makes it really difficult to use. The small N3DS screen doesn't help at all.",
"When all is said and done, Hitman: Sniper Challenge feels more like a polished PSN or XBLA title than the typical demo or cheap DLC item that is bundled with preorders. All it really needs is a few more levels, and it would likely sell well on the digital storefronts. Here's hoping IO and Square make it a full game one day.",
"As a module for showing off your PlayStation VR’s wonders to family and friends, even non-gamers, it makes a fine choice, but players whose imaginations will be rightfully lured and sparked by its dollhouses-within-dollhouses routine will feel shorted by the time the credits roll.",
"Troy is visually captivating, but otherwise struggles in every single aspect so important to Total War series. Somehow, it manages to be overly simplistic and complicated at the same time. The strings just did not attach quite right this time. [Issue#305]",
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a game that should be enjoyed in the right ""vibe"". It brings back a sense of nostalgia for the 90s, while also having a plot that manages to hook us in. The character development is solid and creates bonds with the player. There are some technical issues that patches could fix, as well as some slow moments in the narrative. But, in other words, if you liked the other DON'T NOD narrative games, it's hard not to like this one. [Review based on TAPE 1: BLOOM]",
"While the pseudo-sand box nature of this game does give it more than a passing resemblance to some of the best bits of the three GTA titles we all know and love, it has enough original content to save it from being accused of too much plagiarism.",
I especially recommend it if you’re a fan of adventure games with a lot of puzzles. You definitely won’t be disappointed given how plentiful and unique they are. Overall I am happy I got to play this gem of a game and am looking forward to more from Mojiken.,
"The cutting mechanic is smartly embraced as Revengeance's signature rather than its limitation, a crescendo earned by appreciating the profundity of its stylish combat. This is actually expected of Platinum, but the real surprise is their respect and dedication Metal Gear’s established doctrine. By any definition, Revengeance is beautiful symmetry.",
"BOXBOY! is just so pure, so perfect a puzzler that I wish it had existed way back when, so that in some alternate timeline I would have been able to play decades' worth of sequels to it by now. It's that good. [Issue #15; May/June 2015, p.25]",
"The PS2 version’s graphics are surprisingly close to its XBox/GameCube counterparts, and the licensed soundtrack apes Rockstar’s ""Grand Theft Auto"" interface in its depth and variety.",
"Ikachan left me wanting more, and not entirely in a good way. However, it is a curiosity worth discovering for ardent Cave Story fans who have a distaste for the PC platform. If you are set on playing it, the 3DS is the absolute best platform on which to experience it.",
Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a super addictive and cutesy game that's fun to play both single-player and with friends. I would have loved the option to change the music as it becomes quite irritating when you hear it repeatedly due to difficult stages.,
"None of these are things that alter the story in any tangible way, but they make the player a part of what’s happening in a way that ties into that theme of connectedness. This isn’t your story, but you’re still part of it, even as a passive observer. It’s a story that will continue with or without you, but that doesn’t mean you’re not connected to it as part of the same Bigger Thing as the forest that’s telling the tale.",
"Dead Cells likely won’t convert any roguelike detractors, but it’s a wildly creative and fun title nonetheless. Its game world, characters, and enemies all drip personality. The combat is fluid and gritty, there’s a ton to upgrade and unlock, and it’s easy to get lost for hours within Dead Cells‘ world. While a more prominent storyline and some memorable set pieces would go a long way towards elevating this to being one of the premier platformers of this console generation, Dead Cells remains a must-have. I can’t wait to see what Motion Twin does next.",
"This, then, is a game to experience. It’s a game to point to, and champion, as an innovator in what it presents to players. It’s one of the most novel games ever made. In bite-sized portions, it really should be played.",
"Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is truly an outstanding title and it’s here to rob us of our time and money. Yet, just like the perfect heist; no one will be left the wiser as they’ll all be left with a smile on their face.",
"With more technical polish on the exterior, some better camera work, and a few more clever level designs, Dual would have been quite a thing...but even as it stands, you&#146;ll still find plenty of gameplay value.",
"I'm not sure if Takahashi will ever be able to top Katamari Damacy – for my money, it's one of the greatest video games ever made – but Wattam captures that sense of whimsy and magic in its own way. The care-free music and gosh-darn-huggable character designs make this a must-play for fans.",
"The Walking Dead: Michonne ends up an entertaining, if not quite as satisfying, addition to Telltale’s slowly evolving series. At its worst it simply provides more of the same action and difficult decision making that fans seem to love, and at its best it delivers fresh canonical insight into one of The Walking Dead’s most interesting characters.",
"Beautiful, vast, creative, varied, and exciting, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible game that will have you hooning around Mexico for months. There's an amazing sense of variety to everything about this game, and the smart Accolades system should have many achievement hunters hooked as they explore the full extent of what this remarkable racer has to offer. Fantastic handling, interesting events, and a wonderful history-spanning selection of cars makes for an amazing experience — arguably the best game in the series to date, and inarguably the best game in the series to DOOT. See you in Mexico, amigos...",
"There's really only one downside to the new version: Retro versions of Warlords were played with a paddle controller, a dial that allowed for finer, more nuanced movement. Warlords suffers slightly from the less-precise play forced by analog sticks.",
"You're only a few minutes into this, before you realize that ""more of the same"" was all they aimed to achieve with Riptide. The devs didn't seem to care about anything else, not even ironing out all the kinks of the original game. There will be people who think this was enough, as the basic lot of zombie killing and looting is still intact. In a week where Capcom gives us a Dark Arisen that encompasses all of the original game – Dragon's Dogma – for a much, much lower asking price, you really can't help but feel like someone's having a laugh at your expense.",
"Take two doses of Clint Eastwood badassness, a great Old West story, a slight bit of cheese, and the occasional frustrating misstep in level design, add them all together and you have Call of Juarez in a nutshell.",
"Without a doubt, Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink is a good quality product overall, made by a developer that really seems to know what they're doing when it comes to point and click titles.",
"Get your head around what this is and Harmonix Music VR is a fun little tool to play with but it has no real value and after thirty minutes, you’ve seen everything. It’s close to being something good but Harmonix need to support this with new modes to make it at all worthwhile.",
"Zandatsu is quite a good symbol for this Metal Gear Rising Revengeance : a development divided, fragmented but a game that is highly efficient. Very short indeed, you can see it suffered from this change of direction. Nevertheless, with such a turbulent life, Rising manages to give players a rare and intensive game experience. Definitely, it's an Enfant Terrible, a Son of Liberty.",
"It's hard to argue with the general direction the series has taken, and most players will be happy with the end result, but if you're hoping for a game where true skill always determines the winner there is some disappointment to work through.",
"Iro Hero borrows some ideas from other shoot ‘em ups, but also adds its own flavor. It has a very unique take on design/difficulty, so it might not be for every player, but if you understand it, we think you’ll enjoy it.",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8. is a great package for the hardcore fans of the series, including the first glimpse of how Kingdom Hearts III is going to be in terms of gameplay and feel. Also, Dream Drop Distance's remaster is pretty awesome.",
"While the story is subpar, the stealth mechanics are weak, and the lack of a dodge ability does hinder a solid combat system, this short game–clocking in at around seven to eight hours–is certainly entertaining to play.",
"LEGO City: Undercover is a fascinating adventure that even though it stays close to the franchise roots, it also takes a different approach with its own identity and charming originality. Infused with clever jokes, brilliant puzzles and excellent narrative, it doesn't need far away galaxies nor Middle Earth myths in order to bring pure fun.",
"For Fans of Spiderman – or of Marvel-Games in general – Spiderman Shattered Dimensions is a must-have. The perfect combination of puzzles, fights and show-downs with mighty bosses whets the player's appetite.",
"Tetris has met its match. Lumines: Electronic Symphony is a painstakingly scrawled love letter to puzzle games and electronica of every stripe. Not only should every Vita owner buy it, every person who cares about video games should play it.",
"Vermintide gets so many things right, and its designers have made enough smart decisions about how to deviate from the Left 4 Dead, that it makes the difficulty knee-capping and technical mishaps all the more disappointing.",
The McCall brothers are back in action in this Call of Juarez prequel. The game is an absolutely good looking representation of the American Civil War period and gameplay is pretty solid and fresh. Tons of weapons and good multiplayer action bring you into the wild wild west!,
"Is Soldier of Fortune: Payback a bad game? No, not really. It's a rather enjoyable (if simple) and good looking shooter. It's just that there have been so many amazing playing and looking games in the past few months, that Payback can't compare in comparison.",
"Sega Superstars Tennis isn’t the best tennis game out there, especially since the actual tennis isn’t even as close to being as smooth or challenging as something like the Virtua Tennis or Top Spin games, but it can be just as rewarding for Sega fans and those people looking for a simple and fun approach to the sport.",
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a lovely, sedate open world adventure game that inexplicably gates its crafting mechanic behind an obtuse, tiered system that renders it moot.",
NASCAR is a fine little kart game. The speed is representative of the actual sport and the gameplay is solid enough to warrant you pulling out the Wii Wheel for a spin around track a few times.,
"The Settlers: New Allies may provide decent entertainment for more modest players, but it's not the sequel that fans have been asking for. Although it is visually pleasing. Settlement construction is easy to manage, but lacks more depth, and the same is true with combat. Not a single component is elaborated enough to arouse more interest.",
"The MLB Mode, however, is everything a baseball fanatical could dream of, transforming you into living the life of a major leaguer (or minor leaguer). As such, MLB Power Pros 2008 knocks another one out of the park.",
"Although it can look short, compared to other exploration games, Samorost 3 complements that with the stunning, detailed and almost photorealistic art style of the various landscape scenarios, which are great just by themselves, but adding the various sound effects and music to them creates a great point-and-click exploration game filled with some interesting puzzles.",
"With a lot of previous mistakes corrected by the mini-expansion, Europa Universalis: Rome got its second wind. Vae Victis is worth a look even for those grand strategy fans who dismissed the original game.",
"It uses many stereotypes, brings them to the maximum and keeps us in a world of political incorrectness, showing us hard environment were life is worth nothing: Wild West from cinema and literature enters Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood, turns into a videogame and is still recognizable in all its elements, making the most of the spectacle of the medium.",
"Splatoon 2 provides a second chance at life for the Wii U’s best game, drawing in a new Switch audience with the staples that made the first game great and adding just enough quality of life adjustments and new modes to entice veterans. Robust launch content and a steady stream of promised updates should quickly soothe series naysayers, even if there are still a few desired features off the table. Above all else, Splatoon 2 radiates silly, squiddy fun throughout; a don’t-miss title when you take the plunge and pick up a Switch.",
"How to Train Your Dragon isn't a bad game; given its status as a movie game it has a level of polish that's really quite admirable. The game design, however, is all over the place.",
"Improves upon its predecessor in almost every way. The combat is deep and satisfying, the exploration and loot elements are incredibly addictive, and the dungeons provide a near perfect amount of challenge and consistency to keep you playing to the end. If you're looking for an expansive adventure with an interesting story, massive world and robust combat, Death has come for you.",
"Digital Extremes has set out to create an original 3rd-person, action-shooter powered by next-gen hardware, and in that respect team from London, Onatario has done an incredible job.",
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine delivers exceptionally on a very simple concept: an M Rated slice and dice adventure starring Wolverine that follows the plot of the movie. It never claims to be anything deeper than that, and in a way, that’s why it succeeds.",
"Alida is simply gorgeous. There are some minor flaws, particularly when the backgrounds are in motion as part of transitions between scenes, but, by and large, the visuals are eerily beautiful and surprisingly immersive.",
Wytchwood shares much with its context. The small team of AlienTrap Games managed to create a powerful game that is capable to obscure the derivative nature of its origins. The only guilt that can be attributed to this project is that it wasn't able to determine when it was the right time to put an end to its story.,
"The Settlers: New Allies has a good core loop that, unfortunately, lacks a solid connection with the series' history. There’s too much military action and not enough focus on delivering products to citizens. The land-claiming concept is interesting but under-used. Ubisoft could have used the same gameplay and another name and players might be more interested. But the game does not do enough to differentiate itself from better experiences in the genre. The Settlers: New Allies wants to tweak a classic formula but never finds the best way to do that.",
"The Thaumaturge's gritty, demon-taming take on the monster collecting genre is a welcome twist. Taking place in 1905 Poland, there is certainly some language and actions in the game that can feel uncomfortable, but it all works with the overarching theme of struggling with mental health and personal flaws. Despite the sensitive nature of the story, Fool's Theory does well to not over sensationalize traumatic story beats. Gameplay is simple and engaging, and the combat is easy to learn but can be challenging on higher difficulties.",
"The cardboard is surprisingly robust, the assembly of the sometimes intricate designs is a as time consuming as it is fun. But despite the interesting concept, the minigames that come with it are merely snacks.",
"Whether you’re new to the Splatoon series or a repeat customer, Splatoon 2 has enough to keep players entertained for hours on end. There’s enough variety in the different modes of play, and the solo campaign is almost worth the price of admission alone. The new Salmon Run is gloriously fun and the promise of even more weapons, gear, and modes make this game an easy recommendation to all Switch owners. Really the only glaring issues at launch are the cumbersome and lackluster voice options via the Switch Online App, and perhaps the lack of multiple new modes to play in for veteran gamers. I can see some longtime players experience a “been there done that” in Splatoon 2, but the formula works so well and the game is so much fun to play that I don’t think that will be a major concern for most players. Be a kid (or a squid) again and have some fun!",
"If you yearn for the days of the classic arcade platformer and don’t mind being abused by non-descript astronauts, then Moons of Darsalon could be worth a bit of your time (and money I guess). Just don’t expect the next classic in the genre.",
"With a song list that ranges from Louis Prima to the Ghostbusters theme to Katy Perry, and choreography that includes Charleston and chair dancing, JD2014 makes vamping like a diva (and shedding some pounds in the process) an astonishingly engrossing timesink.",
Easily the best 4X game right now and the best that we&#146;ll see for years to come. The AI of this spectacular title alone will keep gamers talking long after its moment in the spotlight is over.,
"If the idea of politics, sieges and large-scale warfare in your MMORPG appeal to you, and you're willing to wait out the stability and lag issues, Shadowbane may be just the game you're looking for.",
"An expansive downloadable game that's bursting with stuff to do. It's disappointing that cheap mini games and toys are the only incentives for perfecting courses, but even so, the game provides a ton of variety and a consistent level of challenge. Like other great puzzlers on handheld platforms, Minis on the Move will have you searching for your 3DS charger before you know it.",
"Perhaps it could've built on a few features found in V8 Supercars 2 to make it a more complete package, but it still makes great strides for the genre with smart gameplay ideas, great graphics and pitch-perfect car physics ensuring countless hours of enjoyment for genre fans.",
"I can commend Square-Enix for what they were trying to do with XIII-2. I personally didn't think much of XIII as it abandoned the stuff I liked about the series. XIII-2 brings some of it back, making it a great compelling JRPG, but what it brings most for me is that I found it much more fun to play, and that's a correct thing for any game to do.",
"The titular vermin of Vermintide may come in a horde, but they’re all unique, in their weird, chittering way. It almost makes me feel bad about the carnage I’ve spent the last ten hours dealing out to them.",
"Stylish and most of the time entertaining as well, this carnage from the mind of a well known weirdo designer Suda 51 doesn't bring anything new to the table, except for its bizarre aesthetics that may or may not suit you. [Issue#234]",
"If you miss the good old days of arcade blastfests, Cannon Spike is your wish come true. It's a good, exciting, simple game anyone should be able to pick up and play. Yes, it will all be over way too soon, but while it lasts you'll have a blast.",
A Space for the Unbound starts 2023 off right with one of the better narrative romps I’ve had in a long time. A slice-of-life narrative tale set in 90’s Indonesia and filled with supernatural twists finds a way to be compelling to all walks of life thanks to a well-crafted story with a lot of heart. Excellent world design and music help seal the deal. The game is moderately slowed down due to extensive foot travel and some strange point and click mechanics but the rest of the game is so interesting that you learn to roll with it.,
"Developer Nihilistic seems settled on the idea that bringing Resistance to the Vita is an inherently bold and innovative move, and that doing anything truly interesting beyond that is unnecessary. It's not a strictly bad FPS, but it's so damn perfunctory, so set on ticking the absolute minimum number of boxes and moving on, it's largely boring and forgettable.",
"Despite Ontamarama's relatively short story mode, options to increase difficulty, the pursuit of high scores and the Shop will keep players coming back for more. Ontamarama is perfect for younger players as a friendly, approachable gateway into the music/rhythm genre.",
"This 2D Game Boy Advance design, at the very least, vastly improves on the originals, and fixes the game so much that it's now a great, recommended action title. It was definitely worth the long wait.",
"Built to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Final Fantasy, this is a fitting commemoration. The story is wonderful, the writing regularly funny, the turn-based combat is a big reason as to why the series is so adored, and the raising and capturing of Mirages is joyous. Even better, the mass of new content makes it so this version is not only the definitive version, but it's definitely worth a second playthrough after completion - and even worth double-dipping for those who picked the original game up.",
"Back in 2001, when Onimusha Warlords first came out, it was a real step forward in the beat'em all genre. Eighteen years later, despite its laughable length, the joy of discovery remains the same, especially when it comes to its stunning art direction and the simpleness of its gameplay mechanics. Now, we can only hope for further adaptations of the Onimusha saga.",
"New Star GP is a fun title that focuses on simplicity, but still innovates with its retro aesthetics and some additional choices that offer depth and a feeling of accessibility when controlling the vehicle on challenging tracks. The game allows current players to experience the past, embracing simplicity and the spirit of overcoming as drivers.",
"A platformer that's hampered by it's focus on telling a tale of an ecological drama. The enormous environments are widely different, but are all dark an gloomy, while protagonist Gaia can temporarily bring brightness. Gameplay is diverse, even though Gaia could really benefit from the ability to shy away from edges, making the platforming more difficult than necessary. There is a great game here, but it isn't allowed to shine due to the unrelenting desire to get the ecological story across.",
"Featuring a black and white image style and a pure cold weapon combat system, Trek to Yomi creates a unique experience in the style of swashbuckler films. The abundant sense of various details in the game scenes, dynamic weather effects and unique mode of composition all make the game screen look cinematic. However, the overly monotonous enemy behavior patterns, as well as the increasing swarm of monsters in the later game levels, are making the fun of combat quickly decline. The bland story, together with some too far-fetched understanding of Eastern culture, makes the quality of the game storyline less than ideal.",
"The Japanese RPG enthusiasts and the American otakus will get some enjoyment out of the humor, but casual RPG players and Western RPG players should be warned. This game is VERY Japanese. Mugen Souls had a lot going for it, but in the end, turned out to be too convoluted for its own good.",
"Rainbow Skies is an epic adventure with a much improved narrative when compared to its predecessor. Its addictive gameplay makes it an absolute joy to explore every inch of the world, and with a huge amount of customisation options and an abundance of side quests, this superior sequel is sure to keep you enthralled for many, many hours.",
"Its combat is neat if still a bit limited, and its dark direction and weird narrative a bit tainted by self-indulgence, but this is still a Grasshopper grindhouse romp worth most of its issues. The danger, I guess, will always be one drink too many.",
"Reality Fighters is nothing more than a tech demo for PS Vita's augmented reality capabilities. As a game it offers insipid gameplay, poor customization, some bugs and no interest. Forget it.",
"There's an astounding amount of things to do in Lego City Undercover. The story that can take player around ten hours to finish, is just the knob of the Lego-block. Afterwards there's much to build, wreck and collect. The biggest downside is that the city, that functions as a central hub to all of the content, is pretty boring.",
"Whether you buy this game for the excellent single player or as the perfect platforming battle for the friends you’re ready to lose (as it can get more than a little combative), this is one of the games I didn’t know I needed for my Wii. Unless you completely hate the original Mario games or you only play games in 3D, this is a must-buy for Wii owners.",
"Ultimately, King of Seas makes for a great take on the pirate’s life. Admittedly, it’s a slow burner at first and because of the more precise nature of its combat, 3DCloud’s newest game won’t appeal to everyone, so I’d recommend trying the demo first. Should you stick with it, there’s an entertaining world with enjoyable exploration, in-depth combat, and pleasant visuals. Backed up by a great swashbuckling soundtrack, these aren’t shallow waters.",
The addition of a more meaningful political element better helps to recreate the vagaries and intrigues that nations must endure on their long march towards either fame or oblivion.,
"The MotoGP franchise is back on track with 13. After years of disaster after disaster we finally have an installment of which the base works greatly. There’s enough to do in the career mode and the racing sensation is quite strong. There are technical imperfections that’ll drag you out of the experience, along with a meager appearance.",
"The good options for auto fighting, fast forwarding through battles and scores of golems to hunt are brought down by several unfortunate shortcomings. The battle system is generic and battles occur far too often for their own good, making for gameplay that can get boring at times.",
"Fans of the series will be disappointed by the new game due to its lack of depth. If you're able to look beyond this shortcoming, this is a decently playable and visually appealing game that otherwise doesn't have any major problems.",
"While it doesn't have as extensive of a roster of modes as some of its earlier siblings, Lumines: Electronic Symphony is just utterly fantastic in what it does do-most evident in its stellar soundtrack, which returns to the same thematic roots as the original Lumines. Electonic Symphomy must be some sort of alien-technology time machine-turn it on, and suddenly you'll realize it's now hours later.",
"Super Ultra Hyper Remix Dead Rising 3 Arcade Edition EX Plus Alpha is a journey into the past that traces all the masterpieces of Capcom. Unfortunately, the result is repetitive gameplay, though things improve if the campaign is played in coop.",
"As a fan of Super Monkey Ball since 2001, I found myself really happy with Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. The package captures the fun and challenge of the first two games, while also including new content that makes it feel fresh. Banana Mania also offers a ton of content for its price point, and players are guaranteed to find something to love. Sometimes the difficulty level can get frustrating, and the Party Games could use some new options, but the game offers so much good, it's hard to complain. Whether you're a newcomer to the series or a fan from the beginning like me, I can't recommend this one enough.",
"A great interpretation of the Left 4 Dead school, full of love and attention to detail for the Warhammer Fantasy license. Fun, well executed with a lot to offer, a great multiplayer experience.",
"Well-made homage to the early days of gaming with an unfortunate use of AI art. Moreover, its physics system hampers movement while AI behavior can be erratic, making a lot of the puzzling a frustrating experience.",
This is an action packed western experience that will entertain in singleplayer as well as multiplayer sessions. Despite a heavy emphasis on gunslinging the plot and characters are well crafted and manage to stay interesting until the very end. With Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood the bar has been set high for the niche genre that is western games.,
"Despite its flaws, Assault Heroes 2 is a fun and functional arcade shooter that just about anyone can enjoy. Its simple control scheme feels good, and although it is brief, the game is definitely worth the price of admission.",
"May not be the most original game, but in the end, it’s a fun one. If you want to spend a weekend hacking and slashing alone or with online buddies, you can’t go wrong with this game.",
"It's why, unlike Diablo III, I don't foresee myself spending a lot more time with Diablo II: Resurrected. That's not to say the adventure was without merit, and it's certainly great to have a way to play one of Blizzard's classics with a coat of paint that does its visual aesthetic justice so many years later. But outside of players already well-versed with the game's aged design choices and imbalance, there's not a lot here outside of a history lesson for new players to enjoy. A lot of the time spent playing Diablo II: Resurrected, I just longed to return to Diablo III.",
"Jupiter Hell is a richer, more concrete and more enjoyable version of Doom, the Roguelike, from which it borrows the original concept. The result is a more than valid exponent of the genre, which mixes action, strategy and a pinch of RPG without ever being too frustrating, thanks to a good balance and the ability to select different levels of challenge.",
"Need for Speed Unbound brings plenty of style and builds upon the high stakes dynamic established in 2019’s Heat to create an engaging and enjoyable open world racing game. The large emphasis on story falls flat once again particularly during the slow opening hours, and the online mode lacks some of the best aspects of the single player mode, including police and Takeover events. Fortunately, the excellent performance and smart overhaul to the turbo system ensures the moment-to-moment gameplay always feels great, and the huge amount of unlockable vehicles, customization options and optional activities and collectibles means there’s always plenty to do each time you make the trip to Lakeshore City.",
"It doesn’t raise the bar regarding the RTS genre’s standards and it doesn’t really come close to the existing ones, even though it does feature certain innovations over the previous titles of the series. Nevertheless, it’s a game with a solid universe for the background story, a large fan base, more than decent single-player campaign and, in regards to the graphics and sounds, it most certainly can go toe to toe with any RTS released in these last two years.",
"Not only is Alida built around one of the most tired clich&#233;s in the adventure genre (the deserted island filled with Rube Goldberg machines), but also Alida's game engine is woefully dated to boot.",
"OutRun is just as much fun as it was when released more than two decades ago, though the gameplay fundamentals haven't changed much and the series is still in need of a bonafide relaunch. That said, I still love OutRun. I'll never get sick of Heart Attack mode.",
"McQueen truly is &#147;The Cooler King&#148; in more ways than one, which only makes his half-assed showing in this half-assed game a full-fledged bummer. Skip this disaster and rent ""The Towering Inferno"" instead.",
"Pulse is a great idea, translating the isolation of being blind into a funky adventure of discovery. It's just not much more than that really, as the concept can be short-sighted in the long run.",
"Rainbow Skies is the RPG equivalent of a store brand Cola--cheaper, but with far less flavor than the bigger brand names, and liable to go flat on you much faster. It gets the job done if you're looking for a real time sink, and there's potential depth there if you're willing to wade through repetitive combat to get there, but it's simply isn't enjoyable enough to justify the commitment it demands.",
"You’ll only need several hours to complete it, but The Big Con’s one adventure worth looking into. Offering a vibrant presentation brimming with nostalgia, there’s an enjoyable story about 90’s America which kept me hooked. Though the pickpocketing mechanic lacks depth, that’s made up for by a fun narrative and good sense of humour, keeping the action entertaining. If you like indies, The Big Con’s a breath of fresh air that comes recommended.",
"Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection's low price forgives the absence of modes and options we usually take for granted. The problem is it's also lacking what amounts to basic functionality. The arcade ports are lazy and desperately in need of a patch and the online interface was plagued with lag. The worst part is the higher your appreciation for Mortal Kombat's golden years, the more glaring Arcade Kollection's gaffs become.",
"While Age of Wonders 4 doesn’t shy away from depth and complexity, it rarely overwhelms the player. Starting with the faction creator, Age of Wonders 4 is dedicated to letting the player shape their experience as much as possible. No matter how you prefer to play, you’re in for hours of engaging strategy and tactics with an incredible array of mix-and-match fantasy elements.",
"With a no-nonsense interface, more than 100 new cards (to bring the total to over 1,100) and new rules for the summer's Yu-Gi-Oh card-battling competition, WCT2004 is the ultimate up-to-date card-playing sim for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans. [May 2004, p.121]",
"Forced Showdown's design makes it fun to exterminate hordes of enemies for a few hours on various arenas, but later on the progress of unlocking much needed cards stalls significantly, just like our enjoyment.",
"The best compl[i]ment possible to give a puzzle game is that the real reward is the playing itself. You don’t need fancy stories, or whiz-bang effects when you’ve got solid, addictive gameplay. And CRUSH has this in spades--not to mention the presentation is quite nice as well.",
"Despite its quirks and graphics that fall short of the original's, Naval Ops: Commander packs enough firepower to keep fans of the series stoked. Nonfans, however, may quickly get left in its wake. [May 2004, p.65]",
"Bellator: MMA Onslaught has very nice graphics and good A.I. It's just a shame that the animations are so clunky and bad. It feels like MMA Onslaught isn't a finished product, because of the few options and the horrible animations.",
Nihilistic proves that ego-action finally can work rather well on mobile platforms – in theory. But as part of the Resistance franchise Burning Skies is rather disappointing. The formula has been boiled down to run of the mill action with unbelievable characters in rather bland surroundings and forced touch controls that will distract you more than they will help.,
"It's entertaining enough, even for those who aren't major followers of the show, but despite all it has going for it, the short length and repetitive gameplay keep Fullmetal Alchemist 2 from being anything more noteworthy than a weekend rental.",
"The vehicles have a silly propensity to flip upside-down (even at 20mph), and stupid proportional gaffes abound, like a dune buggy that's able to muscle an SUV over a cliff. Which is just insane.",
"Klonoa sees the revival of two beloved, but underappreciated platformer games from the early PlayStation years. While the graphics have been souped up, the gameplay is near identical including its unique use of catching and using enemies. Some quality-of-life changes have been made to make the games more accessible to both old and new players, most notably a more modern use of checkpointing.",
"Shows marked improvement from its predecessor, but it still has a number of issues. The gameplay becomes repetitive after a short while, and there is no Xbox Live mode to be found.",
"While the last boss is unnecessarily cheap (come on, we all saw that coming) and the graphics are nothing to write home about, I was happy to find that there were plenty of nuances to the fighting, and there was clearly much thought given to its design. Senko no Ronde 2 is an oddball title that’s not for everyone and the story mode is a complete waste, but for those who find themselves in the Venn diagram intersection of fighting games, anime, giant robots, and shmups, there’s nothing else on the market like it.",
"Robocalypse is shockingly close to being a fantastic game. Everything it needs to be a solid handheld Warcraft clone is there, from the solid and well-balanced gameplay to the reasonable adaptations of gameplay limitations for use on a Nintendo DS.",
"Sherlock Holmes offers more choice, making you feel like you have a huge influence, and the stories and puzzles make it a very enjoyable game. Unfortunately graphically speaking it is disappointing, and the same goes for the controls.",
"Need for Speed Unbound feels like a breath of fresh air. The arcade-style racing has seen quite a significant improvement from its predecessor, and the game’s general styles and sensibilities definitely make it one of the most unique-looking racing games out there.",
"It may be far less glamorous than new setlists and instruments, but the revamped user interface that underlies the whole experience is the game's most unqualified success. Fixing nearly every problem from previous installments, and layering in a whole new career structure, the new format is brilliant.",
"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth marks the new golden age of the license. It’s a gargantuan and disproportionate game, in addition to being extremely generous. Next to it, FF7 Remake is just a long prologue behind closed doors. The world opens with Rebirth, the universe of Final Fantasy 7 with it. Everything is sublime, fantastic even, and invites you to travel. The deliberately choppy and mysterious narration fulfills its role perfectly and will undoubtedly cause a lot of ink to flow. It’s an almost instantaneous uppercut that never really gives us time to dislocate our jaw. However, everything is not rosy, we have some heaviness here and there, slightly old-fashioned mechanics which rub shoulders with other much more modern systems, but we will happily excuse it as everything else is impressive. It’s beautiful, sublime, for the eyes and the ears, even though the technique sometimes fails when you look closer. The soundtrack, a mix of revamped themes and new features, is certainly one of the best in the series. But it's a whole and taken as a whole, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a real gem.",
"Certainly a big departure from the traditional Sims gameplay and it's all the better for it. It's extremely accessible - although the longish loading times are a bit of a pain - and a hoot to play, with a constant stream of details that'll keep you smiling. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]",
"Clawing its way back to relevance, XIII-2 introduces a heap of new and desirable systems into XIII's familiar architecture, and even though some of them are handled rather clumsily, the final product is ultimately better off.",
"The simple and scaled down options seem to be made for newer players into this kind of market, but the confusing nature of the game if you don't play the campaign first can quickly get frustrating.",
"It doesn’t matter if your first gaming system was the NES or DS; New Super Mario Bros. Wii proves that 2D platformers are still a blast. Longtime gamers will love the countless throwbacks to previous titles, and the multiplayer gameplay is fantastic (albeit hectic) fun for everyone.",
"In the end, Black Book is one game that feels like a great representation of its genre for the uninitiated. It’s a game that exudes charm, despite the depressing landscape it’s set in. Its premise is a perfect match for novice deck-builders, as it creates a solid foundation of understanding for those looking to break into similar experiences.",
"House Flipper manages to scratch a specific itch, but it lacks long-term incentives and just generally feels like a missed opportunity. With more content, polish, interactivity, and customization, this could become a nice sleeper hit. It's serviceable as is, but it won't hold your attention for too long.",
"Manticore - Galaxy on Fire is a simple but very satisfying romp through 3D space. For those like me who were waiting eagerly for this genre to arrive on Switch, Manticore makes a great premiere showing. While its origins on smart phones show through in spots, it still holds up remarkably well on console. Manticore is an easy pick for fans of the genre, and a great premier space shooter on Switch.",
"Diablo 2: Resurrected updates the graphics of a great, classic action RPG for a new generation. It masterfully preserves the mood of a singular game, and at the same time it preserves the gameplay as it has been for over a decade – mostly for better, occasionally for worse. Unfortunately, parts of that gameplay that were standard 20 years ago just look bad now, or feel like a waste of our time. Those looking for the old king can find it right here, but they might want to politely bow rather than kneel.",
"Those expecting the same level of depth and strategy as Valkyria Chronicles will likely end up disappointed by this spin-off. When judged on its own, though, Valkyria Revolution delivers an interesting narrative and some solid, if unspectacular, action. It’s too bad that the game never truly hits a stride, as missions are rarely memorable, and ultimately a lot of interesting ideas never get fully fleshed out.",
Legends of Eisenwald presents players with a game that takes place on a broad canvas without the freedom to dive deep into it. That is not a bad thing but a different approach. Sometimes that is all a player is looking for.,
"Knights and Bikes is a great and a beautiful way to kill a handful of hours with a friend. You can play solo but as a game with such a heavy focus on friendship, it only seems right to have a friend by your side, either physically or virtually, to go on a colorful adventure and deal with some real life heavy subjects.",
"Age of Empires has been one of the most beloved RTS in the Nineties; this release, which is a carbon copy of the original, is the result of a nostalgia operation that we did not need.",
"Soccer fans will find it boring because it's too fast and too vapid, while nonfans will probably find it little more than a mildly distracting ball-themed action thing. It's reasonably well executed for what it is, but it could very well be something that no one wants.",
"As a straight-port with added multiplayer, developers Denki have done a decent job with Quarrel. Moving forward, there's plenty to build on in order to establish this as a successful series. When it comes down to business, Quarrel does its best to puff out its chest, but loses breath quicker than expected upon first playing. There's no doubt this is a charismatic, challenging and fun way to spend your time, if you don't mind some irritating tendencies along the way.",
"Simply put, if you’re playing with a friend who’s sitting beside you on the couch – the campaign has no online co-op – you’ll likely love Revelations 2. If you’re stuck relying on the mostly-useless AI, you’re in for a far more frustrating experience.",
"Having not played wither Klonoa before this review, I was expecting a bubbly platformer that was a product of its time, but instead, I was floored by how beautiful Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series was, and by how strongly it connected with me on an emotional level. I hope see more of this in the genre.",
"But if you're a fan and you missed even one of these games the first time around, invest in Mega Man Zero Collection right away -- Zero needs to finish his fight, and he's waiting for you to wake him up.",
"Its replay value is impervious to boredom – you will never, ever want to part with this game. It is a classic that will go down in gaming history as one of Nintendo's best offerings.",
"Neon White is an absolute delight of a speed-running game. It's easy to pick up and play, and it has enough bite that you need to master how to shave off a few seconds from your time to proceed. More importantly, it feels really good to do so. The plot is fun, if not groundbreaking, and the likeable characters keep you invested. Aside from some backtracking that I wasn't fond of, Neon White hits all the marks and hits them well. Just be prepared to start playing and discover that eight hours have flown by.",
"Batman Arkham Knight is the best entry in the series. Rocksteady knows perfectly how to explode the formula established years ago, making amazing additions in terms of gameplay. You must play this game.",
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII undoubtedly has a cult, niche following, as games don’t usually receive that many sequels without such a following. However, this is one niche that is as obscure for newcomers as it is deep, and it’s certainly an instance where real-time strategy simply does not fit on the console with a controller. If you’re a fan of this series, save yourself from grief and pick it up on PC.",
"You can ""create the ultimate coaster -- and ride it!"" But at the same time you can do very little else, and while the ride might be the ultimate, too much else just seems to be missing.",
"Our favorite new addition to the Gears multiplayer family, however, is Horde. A fiveplayer co-op romp played on any of the 15 maps, Horde throws wave after wave of increasingly difficult Locust foes at you and your friends for 50 rounds, putting your teamworking skills to the ultimate test.",
"Heroes III and Heroes V combine into a great addition to the M&M universe. The many improvements offer one of the most challenging games in the market, albeit a bit frustrating due to its ""cheap"" A.I.",
"New Super Mario Bros. Wii may not be as innovative as Super Mario Bros. or Super Mario Bros. 3, but it stands on its own through pure quality and is easily one of the best Mario titles.",
"Namco Museum does a lot of things right - but despite the wonderful presentation, it’s still only focused on a limited audience. Putting a value on retro games can often be difficult given how easy it is to obtain and play these titles elsewhere; that said, Namco have put together an extremely desirable package that fits very nicely on the Switch. If it was cheaper it would be easier to recommend to everyone, but as it stands you’re only likely to pick this one up if you’ve got some retro-tinted specs like me. For those of us who do though, it’s a fantastic trip down memory lane.",
"Road To Ballhalla is a delight. It rises above its inspirations to bring a new musical sensibility to the action puzzle genre. While some levels can be frustrating or even punishing, it never feels unfair — clearly a huge amount of thought has gone into balancing the difficulty, and anyone who brings a steady hand and a good amount of patience will find one of the most wonderfully kinetic puzzlers around.",
"While Concord offers solid gameplay mechanics, its uninspired characters and limited content make it fall short of expectations. The visuals may be appealing, but the lack of depth in both lore and game modes leaves much to be desired. It's a game with potential, but it struggles to make a lasting impact in its current state.",
"It attempts to focus on stealth, but fails. It features poor combat, and there are not any puzzles to speak of. The game lacks any significant focus, and as a result, lacks any specific strength. Of course, the god-awful controls didn't help either.",
"Starship Troopers: Extermination's cooperative battles are mechanically innovative and can be enormous fun, but a general lack of polish and a slapdash single-player hold it back from greatness.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is perhaps not the major structural leap forward that its predecessor was – it is, to use the classic phrase, an evolution not a revolution. To get the most out of its major new technical features, you’ll need to really dig down into the depths of the pre-match menu systems – and that’s not for everybody. Meanwhile, Ultimate Teams is as problematic as ever with its carefully greased compulsion loop of in-game purchases and micro-improvements to your fantasy squad.",
"Gwent: Rogue Mage is the perfect example of how to reinvent yourself in an effective way. The playing card strategy game from the Witcher saga, even after all this time and variations, is still capable of holding on. A bit of variety in situations and encounters would not have damaged the experience, but the overall result is a well crafted experiment.",
This Definitive Edition is the best version possible of one of the greatest JRPG of the last twenty years: do you need any other reason to buy it aside from this one? This is Takahashi at its best.,
"Fall of Cybertron has a lot of what made the original game so great, but it suffers from generation loss, relinquishing a portion of its quality in the cloning process. The decision to give players more of the same is made less palatable by the fact that its story is nowhere near as engaging and the multiplayer has not expanded in any way -- and even been scaled back in the case of Escalation.",
"The game has been out in Russia for almost two years and now proves to be an insiders’ tip. The maps are huge, up to 25 square kilometers and there are up to 1.500 units on them. The graphics are dated, the background music can be annoying, but the game itself is thrilling and offers a lot of tactical depth.",
"This year's NBA 2K game is one of the best in recent years. The MyCareer mode has an actual interesting story with a great cast of characters. The Jordan challenge is an incredible addition to the game and is really fun to play through. MyTeam is basically the same as last year but added Triple threat co-op, which is cool. The game does have some framerate issues and camera bugs which could be annoying but every good aspect of the game makes up for it.",
"Dynasty Warriors Strikeforce definitely has the same appeal (or lack thereof depending on your point of view) of its predecessors, but its long list of characters, upgradable attacks, varied weapons and bonus missions gives the series the kick in the ass it has so desperately needed for the last few years.",
"Pikuniku is an eye-pleasing, entertaining outing that just oozes charm, with characters who are endearing without ever becoming irritating. If you want a game that will have you grinning with joy, then pick up Pikuniku.",
"It's fun, it's got appeal to comic book fans, it's got appeal to game fans far beyond the limits of Street Fighter, the online play is well put together, and the game constantly looks and sounds great.",
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series brings together the two main games of the franchise, updating aesthetic elements and adapting details to the present time without mischaracterizing what made the series stand out in the not-so-distant past. Even with some occasional dated details, the collection is great for introducing the brand to a new generation.",
"Retro gamers, rejoice! Alwa’s Legacy is finally available on the Nintendo Switch, and boy does it feel good being here. If you have a Pro controller, do not hesitate to hook this bad boy up to the TV and play like you’re a kid again. Alwa’s Legacy will remind you of days gone by, when renting a game from Blockbuster and trying to beat it within a few days to avoid racking up crazy prices was the thing to do, and with pizza in one hand and drink of choice in the other, you really can’t go wrong making a retro night out of this. Be sure to check out Alwa’s Legacy for a fresh game with a familiar feel.",
"The fun skating of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater turned into a bloodsport is wildly entertaining, especially with the vibrant art style and fitting soundtrack, but Rollerdrome's scope is rather limited beyond that. Players who fancy the challenge of shooting for the optimal run to attain a personal best may get sucked in, but those hoping for much beyond the eponymous sport won't find a deep narrative or character development to latch onto.",
"The lack of multiplayer will hurt it with some people, but the sheer number of upgrades and collectables should keep gamers coming back for awhile. Besides that, it's a whole lot of fun.",
"I came into Strong Bad's expecting quality adventuring, the unique comedic stylings that make me feel like I'm a kid watching Rocko's Modern Life again, and some good old fashioned The Cheat kickin'. That's exactly what I got, and there was virtually nothing throughout the experience that annoyed or dissatisfied me.",
"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is thoroughly entertaining, but a combination of niggles and obscure design decisions drag it down. Despite that, it's still probably the best Spider-Man game on consoles and is well worth a look for that reason alone. Just don't expect to be blown away.",
"In my mind, said mixed bag, when emptied onto the table, would yield all manner of mostly shiny looking baubles, most of which have some redeeming features but very few of which are worth pursuing for longer than a couple of minutes.",
"The visual upgrades give a fresh look to the game, however the same cannot be said for the gameplay that comes straight from 1999. PAC-MAN World Re-PAC gives the opportunity to those who loved the original game to see it with a fresh eye, while at the same time fans of old school 3D platformers that missed it back in 1999, have now the chance to try it out.",
"Whether you know all five Combaticons that form Bruticus by name, or have never seen a robot change into a car outside of a Shia LaBeouf movie, it's hard not to love this fun action shooter from High Moon Studios.",
"A really decent beat 'em-up game. It is a shame that the developers didn't include a co-op mode, which this game screams for it. If you are a fan of this series, then you will enjoy this game.",
"Valkyria Revolution is a rather canonical JRPG, seeking its own identity within the SEGA gaming universe, succeeding only in part. The combat system is unreliable, and its hybrid nature does not fully exploit the interesting ideas of which the game is still dotted. The Media.Vision game stands out for the topics dealt with, the great atmosphere and the extraordinary OST. It is a shame that the heart of gameplay is not as powerful.",
"Toy Soldiers: War Chest is a great idea marred by unforgivable, technical flaws. Even with all of the problems that the game has, I still get enjoyment out of playing it, but it should be so much better.",
"It’s so resolute in its silliness, it’s also nearly impossible to dislike. Sure, its an imperfect game, but amidst the cynicism and midlife crises of other recent video gaming juggernauts, it was exactly the game I needed.",
"Superhot: Mind Control Delete feels like the fulfillment of the promise so many saw in the game when it was just a browser-based demo. With expanded mechanics, this takes an already smart concept and turns it into a powerhouse of design work. Part puzzler and part shooter - whatever it is, it's a truly unique experience worth checking it out.",
"Ironically, it’s people who haven’t played Champions rather than veterans who could find the most to like, given that it’s a year’s worth of tweaks and polish on that game’s largely positive foundation. [Apr 2005, p.105]",
"Unparalleled graphics, improvements to the combat system and a longer gameplay experience don’t completely make up for a weak storyline and other annoyances, but the result is still solid.",
"Monochroma is a good puzzle platformer with a remarkable artistic level, inspired by famous products such as ICO and Limbo, however, the game mechanics are sometimes affected by imprecise controls and a physics engine not always responsive. The social commitment of the developers is laudable.",
"UI issues aside, I have been enjoying my time with Throne and Liberty, and do plan to play more of it post-review. I’m still not entirely sure the end-game content is going to be for me, but NCSoft seems to be putting out steady updates and has a solid content plan in place so far which seems promising. Even without engaging in the PvP side of things I still feel that I have plenty of other things to do within the world, and provided you’re not just mainlining the story to hit level cap as quickly as possible, you’ll likely be pleasantly surprised by how much Throne and Liberty has to offer right out of the gate. Considering it’s free-to-play, I see no reason to not check it out whenever you have a chance.",
"Iro Hero is a decent enough shooter that doesn’t want you to see how good it could be. The lack of continues or any aid in progression will leave newcomers to the genre feeling cold enough to probably put them off altogether. Unless you really want to put a great deal of effort into memorising levels that seem to take forever to complete, the chances are that you will quickly bore at the thought and disregard the idea completely.",
"EA Sports FC 25 marks a turning point for the better in the renewed football franchise. Of course, it carries some vices from the past, but it is far from those disastrous moments or those that showed a lack of interest among followers of this type of games. We can say that the foundation is being built for a total football experience that satisfies casual and demanding players and that is saying a lot, as it breaks with the mediocre period of recent years. We are sure that this year's installment will have more fun for you and that you will scream with emotion for each goal as if it were real, so, believe it or not, there are more good ones than bad ones this year. Happy start to the football season.",
The storyline is excellent and the adventure portions recall memories of the classic (and now all but dormant) point-and-click genre. The problem lies in the fact that the game focuses most of its energy on trying to be an action platformer and at that it is simply average at best.,
"Trek to Yomi is a visual masterpiece with a solid story, unfortunately let down by its gameplay. Whilst there are some enjoyable elements, it doesn't hold up when compared to numerous recently released peers that do samurai combat better.",
"Electronic Arts and Maxis could have phoned in this last expansion pack for The Sims 3, but Into The Future is as complete and finished off as the equally strong Supernatural expansion. The wealth of new items, the introduction of Plumbots, and how well it integrates the influence of time make this downloadable content worth the price of admission.",
"Featuring outstanding cinematic presentation, first-rate voice performances, and superb sound design, Trek to Yomi wraps Akira Kurosawa-like flair around its fun, side-scrolling samurai battles.",
"However, at its marked-down price it does offer a low-risk introduction to the series for anyone who's not yet experienced the undeniably satisfying feeling of cleaving a path through an entire army of foot soldiers.",
"EA FC 25 plays it safe with solid football, avoiding too much risk or complexity, which makes sense from a business perspective. However, many players are starting to lose patience with the lack of innovation in sports games year after year. The new FC isn’t a complete copy-paste of its predecessor and does bring improvements with certain new features. It’s definitely the best football game on the market right now and one of the top sports games overall, but there’s certainly room for improvement.",
"Shovel Knight Showdown is great for short sessions with friends, or a couple playthroughs of the story mode, but simple movesets and repetition limit the enjoyment. You can dig into some good Shovel Knight fun here, but don’t expect to strike gold.",
"Sakaguchi knows how to make great JRPGs. The Last Story is a memorable and magical work. The combat system is brilliant, it's fun, and Nobuo Uematsu's music helps you to remember the great games of the genre. Nintendo Wii has another essential. Zael will be your friend.",
"Diablo II: Resurrected is a faithful remaster of the original that defined the gold standard for the action role-playing genre. With 4K graphics, a higher frame-rate, fully remade cinematics, and a vast array of quality of life changes, this is an experience that serves as a love letter for nostalgic and veteran players and an enticing invitation for newcomers.",
"Age of Wonders 4 offers a profound gameplay when we talk about pure strategy, despite the battles are not at the same level. There is no doubt that it's a great entry to the genre and the Paradox portfolio.",
"Sorry We're Closed is an action adventure horror that brings back to our monitors gameplay and techniques born in the 1990s, adding a modern story about love, loss, and acceptance, flavoring it all with combat and puzzles that integrate nicely into the experience and do not seem included just to add a couple of hours to the time it takes to see one of the multiple endings. Despite the strong personality of the protagonist and the other characters, the direction of the production is not always evident, with action and puzzler sections easy for veterans of the genre but almost too many for story mode lovers. An excellent debut, in any case.",
"It really, really pisses me off, that I need Wii controllers to play a Wii U game. This right here is a true ass-fruit of a game design, where a four year old game has been ported to a new console generation nearly the way it was back then. [Jan 2014]",
"At times, it can become annoying how slowly the Bones move around the screen, but it does add just a little more longevity to this first installment, which clocks in at just several hours long.",
"You feel like the most clever person on the planet when you're able to bring in three parts a day, slaughter a few frogs, and birth seventy Pikmin without breaking a sweat...what is there is enormously fun.",
"Rock Band 3 is the best music game option around. The more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it. But my bet is that most people will just buy the game and nothing more. And while that experience is still solid, it's not all that different from Rock Band 2.",
"Quite a fun game, though it is a Japanese RPG so expect seemingly endless screens of dialogue that can (thankfully) be skipped through if you don't mind missing a few jokes. There is also a lot of explaining about exactly what all of the mechanics do from the Explanatory Shampuru.",
"Troy is a step in the right direction, polishing and improving many aspects of the series. We’ll have to wait to the next main entry in the franchise, but until then it is a game worth your time.",
"For Formula 1 lovers, the ""Classic"" mode alone justifies the purchase of this 2013 edition, as Codemasters has managed to create a second game in the heart of a simulation that was already a reference. The best F1 races of yesterday and today are transcribed in a game that breathes the passion and love for this motorsport.",
"Perhaps I have been rather critical of Button City; there is something sweet in its cuddly art style and although its dialogue and narrative may be try-hard, it is effective at times. The real issue is that it feels like its developers have relied too hard on simply being cute rather than focusing on creating engaging gameplay. Regardless of how adorable the protagonist and their friends may be, there’s just not enough here to hold my attention.",
"Another triumph in the soulslike genre from South Korea, The First Berserker: Khazan blends the best elements of Nioh and Dark Souls while forging its own identity. Standout boss battles and a deep, refined combat system ensure it leaves a lasting mark on the genre.",
"High Hell is a challenging, cathartic, and unique shooter. There is beauty in its obnoxious aesthetics, and satisfaction in its fast-moving, mouse-mashing violence. It is a very short game, but one I expect to see become a darling of speedrun weekends and Twitch streams. High Hell is an anarchic injection of neon-pink adrenaline, made with a dirty needle. At only ten bucks, it's a dang cheap way to stick it to The Man.",
Diablo II: Resurrected is a huge accomplishment for a remastered game. It preserves the original game in amber while still showing just why it was considered a legendary game in the first place. It is perfect for veterans to jump back in and play as if you have been playing it for the last 20 years. It is also still approachable to new players who can finally see what all the hype is about.,
"Ikenfell occasionally loses its way with repetitive puzzles and rehashed narrative beats, but its great soundtrack, challenging combat, and well-told story make its magical campus well worth exploring.",
"OVIVO is a great example for a genius mix between gameplay, soundtrack and design. It is a must have game for anyone that wants to experience story in unique ways to enjoy great music and gameplay. OVIVO is a short game, too short, that feels like a taste from something perfect, and you want more from it.",
"It’s just a lackluster experience from head to toe, and while I’d like to champion the idea of more unlikely releases making their way to North America, it’s really hard to do so when faced with a subpar release like Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers.",
"Though it’s a little shorter compared to its predecessors, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is a collection worthy of your time. The HD treatment on Dream Drop Distance is excellent. Birth by Sleep 0.2 - A Fragmentary Passage is a gorgeous prologue to Kingdom Hearts III, and while Kingdom Hearts X (key) Back Cover is the weakest link in the collection, it lets fans efficiently catch up on that chapter of the story. While it may just be an appetizer, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is a fine example of why we’re still excited for the future of the franchise.",
"The beautifully rendered graphics are amazing and keep you in awe. The voiceovers match their counterparts and make you feel like your watching the TV series. The controls are tight and responses, except for the occasional platforming sections where things can get unnecessarily difficult due to some jumping issues.",
"Lots of light, little shadow! The new Commandos adventures are every bit as good as the old games and, naturally, even better than they were back then in technical terms. The test version was already in perfect condition, with no crashes or stuttering whatsoever. However, Claymore Games must be criticized for not breaking any new ground in terms of innovation and relying entirely on the old warhorses who liked the gameplay back in 1998 and have no desire for major changes. Because there's nothing really new here. So if you like the gameplay and first got to know it through a game like Shadow Tactics, then we highly recommend taking a trip to the mother of the sub-genre. However, if you were actually expecting something new in the realm of real-time tactics, you might be slightly disappointed. The origins are also reflected in the game design – this is a return to the roots, not a move towards new branches.",
"Simple puzzles and bland chases prevent Close to the Sun from living up to its numerous inspirations. While the game has a decent retro style and an intriguing horror narrative, it never makes the player a true participant.",
"It is an RPG with a very strong personality, but its story is dense and it's really difficult to follow considering the fact that the previous games weren't available in our region. As a game, it doesn't disappoint, even though there are better options out there.",
"Wattam features a truly unique design and concept and happens to be much deeper than expected, but technical issues and a certain lack of creativity prevent the game from reaching its full potential.",
"Giving players more of the same isn’t always a bad thing and Splatoon 2 gives Switch owners another fantastic game to add to their lineup. Taking the formula from the Wii U original and tweaking it here and there the game might not surprise all that much, but it does deliver a fantastic and unique shooter experience from start to finish.",
"Kill Team is not a bad game, but it's also one that never really shines. Unless you're a die hard WH40K fan, or are in desperate need of some local multiplayer action, you can safely skip this.",
"Everything about my experience points to GATO Studio either running out of time or money (or both) before they could complete The Waylanders. A story that starts off in a fresh setting and filled with interesting characters, nice visuals and outstanding voice acting is quickly derailed by technical flaws and an ever-growing list of bugs. I rarely complain about too many side missions or additional features like romantic endeavors being added to a game, but this is a perfect example where cutting out unnecessary features would have allowed GATO Studios to focus on the things that really mattered. Sometimes, less can be more, and that appears to be the case here.",
"If you're looking for a fun adventure in the same vein as ""Luigi's Mansion,"" The Haunted Mansion should be perfect for you. It proves to be good fun without even being too rough or challenging.",
"Delivers riotous entertainment in spades. As a solo experience, it’s up there with Mario’s illustrious platform predecessors; with four players in tow, it’s breathtaking in its constantly hilarious chaos.",
"First trailers gave the impression that this would be a fresh take on the familiar police chief formula, putting us in the shoes of the young Lily Reed. But no – once again we’ll be playing as Jack Boyd, doing the same old job with some half-baked new features. [Issue#232, p.60]",
"Loop Hero is a creative and clever little game that should be on your radar if you enjoy strategy, RPGs, deckbuilders, roguelikes, or all of the above. While its novelty begins to wither the further you get away from your opening hours, the journey is worthwhile and engaging.",
"Venetica is a good Fable clone: the story is interesting, the gameplay easy to play. The only weak point is the bad graphic: the game isn't very enjoyable even on the newest computer.",
"Undeniably dated and simple, and the action is a bit plodding and straightforward. Fortunately, the underlying gameplay is good enough that it won't betray the fond nostalgia of older fans.",
"With 43 mini-games it includes enough substance to warrant a purchase, especially if you like the “party game” genre. While the offline modes may lack in terms of a single-player experience, games like FF2 really succeed because they are fun to play with other people.",
"The bottom line is that Go Mecha Ball is an arcade snack that you won't spend dozens of hours playing, but which fits perfectly into short breaks when you just want to have a quick game. For this purpose, the imaginative mix of pinball and two-stick shooter is actually really good. It's just a shame that it lacks an equally strong level design and more options for experimenting with different play styles.",
"Playing mini-games and watching a movie featuring yourself and your friends is fun the first few times, but it wears off fast. The game does a good job of including everyone and providing a fun time, and the Director's Mode extends its value, but if you already own the camera and get tired of party games easily, perhaps there isn't a good enough reason to jump into this purchase.",
"The Definitive Edition has a way about it that just feels right, to the point where I had to do a double-take and watch a video of the original just to see if I was going crazy. No, the 1997 edition never looked this good, and the remaster doesn't douse its legacy in any way.",
"These visual novel are both a relic of the past, and not the ideal entry point for newcomers of the genre, but are still dark and fascinating trips in the beginning of Suda 51's acclaimed career.",
"Sine Mora EX is a revamped version of a shoot'em up originally published five years ago. The game sports an astounding art direction, a little less challenging difficulty, and a great playability, with a plethora of options that will suit every gamestyle, including the long-awaited local multiplayer.",
"A stylish, well-voiced, visual novel that tells a poignant and heartfelt story over five, one-hour episodes, We Are OFK is more interactive TV series than game. Let yourself drift away in its peaceful melancholia, but don’t expect much in the way of gameplay.",
"Visually astounding with a weighty handling model and some super clever design, Need for Speed Unbound is easily the best Need for Speed in years. Though the single-player story campaign is a little less inspiring than it needs to be both in terms of its plot and content, Need for Speed Unbound nonetheless sets a resoundingly solid foundation for the Need for Speed franchise to evolve into the future and is essential for fans of both the series and the street racing genre at large.",
"There is much more to praise this game for: the complexity of it’s deckbuilding and tile placements and how these can be a test of knowledge to maximise their potential; the superb blend of gameplay mechanics intertwined with the theme of entropy and destruction as well as the open-design methodology towards accessibility with a series of optional aids. But to talk about these more would be a disservice to the rewarding experience of discovering these mechanics for yourself, so here’s where I’ll leave it...I can think of no higher praise than to admit that even as I write this review, I have Loop Hero playing in the background. My adventurer, step by step, ticking away at his sisyphean struggle to restore the world.",
"In this case, I think simpler would have been better. Stripping out some of the needless camera angles and the slow-mo would make it to focus on Kill Team's strengths, like the fact that it's impressively fun to annihilate a horde of Orks with a rocket launcher. As it is, Kill Team is a reasonably fun promotional vehicle for Space Marine, but a sloppy one.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played.",
"Forget the strive for realism, FIFA Street 2 is a pure unadulterated videogame take on footie. It's fun, fun, fun throughout the game and there's a surprisingly deep single-player experience to sustain your interest.",
"For every developer or publisher who's ever dreamed of pushing beyond the demographic limitations of ""hardcore"" or ""casual"" gamers, here is how you do it. And were that universal appeal NSMB Wii's sole achievement, it would be one of the most important games in recent memory. But, no: It's also ridiculously fun. [Grade = A+]",
"Forza Horizon 5 sets a new industry gold standard for racing game visuals, gameplay, and map design. Our expectations of map design just leveled up with Horizon 5, and it’s another massive victory for Game Pass members who will get it on release day. The good news for players is that there’s future DLC content to come, which will only add to what is comfortably the most exciting next-gen racing game released so far.",
"There's an awful lot of gaming to be had here. While the updated version of the first Dead or Alive is only worthwhile for nostalgia's sake, the revamped DOA2 is a graphical masterpiece, and a blast to play online.",
"The improvements that Champions: Return to Arms makes over its predecessors are modest, and after four years of roughly the same game, the fundamental formula is starting to feel a little tired.",
"Truth be told, I had to blow dust off the Wii before putting New Super Mario Bros Wii into the drive. But only Nintendo's device could ever push a 2D game as their big holiday number - and it's fantastic that they have.",
"There’s an awful lot to love about Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos, especially for those who were huge fans of SNES-era 2D adventures. It wears its influences proudly, and mixes them up with compelling Rogue-like elements. Sure, a bit more challenge would be nice, but when exploring, solving puzzles and progressing is this much fun, who really cares?",
"Knights and Bikes serves as a powerful nostalgia trip that’ll take you back to your imagination fuelled childhood adventures. With pretty much every aspect tightly crafted to exude a childlike spirit, the art style, animation, soundtrack, and gameplay all help give authenticity to the story of Nessa and Demelza’s burgeoning relationship. While a touch more challenge – especially in the combat – would have been welcome, the breezy pace of the story will help captivate your attention, not only with its themes of friendship and self-discovery, but more importantly through its correct instruction in how to apply jam and cream to a scone.",
"As an homage to Akira Kurosawa’s contributions to Japanese cinema, Trek to Yomi is an unparalleled adventure to the shores of hell and back that meticulously encapsulates and delivers an experience through his lens. It’s when you look behind its eyes that you discover the game’s soul is missing in a disappointing case where a wellspring of style and authenticity is anchored by a sad lack of substance.",
"Dancing All Night looks like it’s set to be the final game before we have to say goodbye to our favorite cast of characters in Persona 4, and I’m perfectly fine with that. The Investigation Team solves one more mystery, and they’ve once again reminded us never to lose sight of our ‘true selves’. I’d say that’s a job well done.",
"Throne & Liberty was a game I wanted to love. It was something I had anticipated for roughly a decade with the hope in my heart that it would be good. I see the skeleton of something I adored — the massive PvP battles, the caution that came with entering places like the Ants Nest to get rare jewelry and a social component that I honestly sorely miss. But the poor localization, an uninteresting story, and the reliance on PvP for progression makes the game a hard recommendation. It’s a shame, because there is a glimmer of something great there, but Throne & Liberty just isn’t that.",
"Well crafted city builder, which takes you through the ages of one the most important parts of the world. Mesopotamia looks beautiful, but the gameplay itself can get both tricky and boring. [Issue#309]",
"Developer Heavy Iron has captured the show's personality perfectly. The 3D characters look exactly like their cartoon counterparts, and it's stuffed with classic Doo touches to the bursting point. [July 2002, p.120]",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a Souls-like with excellent combat and striking anime-style visuals, but its quest system and limited weapon variety may not appeal to everyone. Fans of Nioh will likely feel right at home.",
"Or at least if it were more wildly satirical. Instead, it falls somewhere in between: the middle of the road where nothing really interesting happens except the same repetitive and boring tasks. [Holiday 2004, p.70]",
"Omen of Sorrow is a really good fighting game that works well and has some really interesting mechanics that change the entire aspect of the fighting game, but because of the price, it bring down so many other aspects of the game making it a difficult purchase to recommend. Maybe when the game lowers in price, more people will pick it up. That’s the only thing I can think of that would help more than anything. It’s a good fighting game, but when there’s no one to play it with, you can only enjoy it for so long.",
"The biggest addition is the inclusion of collectables from each course, which provides a great incentive to exploring in Freeride mode, and brings a touch of Amped's atmosphere to a game that was all about the rush. [Dec 2003, p.106]",
"Undeniably, Darksiders II is a gem shaped by passionate gamers for gamers. It's beautiful, it's epic, it's super-rich and varied, and even though the ending falls short compared to the journey itself, it would be a crime not to pay tribute to the impressive amount of work and effort Vigil put into this game.",
"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is everything the long time fans of the franchise were yearning for but didn't get for a long time. The story will be relived and retold, but now there's uncertainty about the fate of each character. Every expectation was met with surprise and reward in a game that is not perfect, but is a true masterpiece of a genre that became popular exactly because of the long running Square Enix franchise.",
"The combat, especially the close quarters engagements, feel both exciting and perilous and only groups that work well together will be able to reach the end of the level and get a chance to try out for cool loot.",
"Mugen Souls tries to take a few stabs at making fun of games such as Disgaea while itself committing the same atrocities – i.e. needless grinding, relying on stat maximization and an insane amount of battles. A tactical RPG at heart, filled with equal measures of gothic Lolita fetishizing and wicked humor, Mugen Souls is a quirky little gem that will satisfy the most hardcore number crunchers, while leaving the rest of us slightly bored after the first hours.",
"With OutRun Online Arcade SEGA has come up with a nice game for only ten euro's. It looks nice, has an error here and there, but the soundtrack makes up for it. Players can surely enjoy this game for hours.",
"Commandos 2 – HD Remaster is still very much the same game from nineteen years ago but sadly, it has not aged well. The release of this HD remaster is clearly premature and only time will tell if it can be saved. However, I do admit that the game isn’t unplayable and if you’re willing to look past some of the issues, Commandos 2 is still a fun and challenging game.",
"Evotiction came out of nowhere to deliver a pure stealth experience, a genre that has almost faded. While it may be a bit on the shorter side, its well-designed gameplay mechanics make it stand out.",
"PlayStation's new hero shooter is not off to a good start due to the lack of content and poorly defined characters. However, Concord has plenty of potential to become a good game, but it needs to take advantage of it and the market is not going to make it easy.",
"Troy can’t hold its own against the main entries of Total War series. But its purpose is to introduce new players to the series, and in that regard, Troy is more than adequate. [Issue#248,p.44]",
"Overall Zombie Driver HD is an enjoyable fast paced driving game where killing zombies comes as standard. Despite the lack of multiplayer, if you're looking for a game that you can just relax and play without getting stressed out, but still want a challenge if desired, then you'll enjoy what's on offer here, and if you have 800MS Points ready to spend, just go for it.",
"Loop Hero is one of those games that can be described as perfect, with the meaning of achieving just what it wants without flourish. It will hook you, and you'll can't say no to one more loop.",
"This is a great game. There are so many elements to this title that will knock your socks off. It is not the true NFL simulator that is Madden, but it is an awesome football game that plays better than the competition in many regards.",
"Good acting, a formidable world and a truly interesting story: Wilson's Heart is a great adventure game. Especially in VR the game is breathtakingly beautiful and creepy at the same time. Sometimes it feels like the studio does not trust the gamers though.",
This sort of game lives or dies on how much support it receives from the developers but at this point in time Bloodhunt is a blast that is sure to entertain Battle Royale players and fans of the Vampire IP.,
"Splatoon 3: Side Order is a worthwhile DLC complementing excellently the main game. It could include a bit more variety in its objectives and levels, nevertheless, its great visuals and fun gameplay will surely be appreciated by fans of the game.",
"Having come up with an intriguing premise, it would have been all too easy for Capcom to cut corners beyond that, relying on the gimmick alone to garner sales. Thankfully, that is definitely not the case with Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, which is a quality piece of work at every level.",
"As a simulation of the full flying experience, this one-man project can't compete with the refinement of ""FS2004,"" but for the tinkerer or virtual pilot looking for unique flying experiences, it's a fun toolkit to dive into. [Ver 7.40; Apr 2004, p.93]",
"Forza Horizon 5 is the leap to the new generation of Xbox. Playground Games has been able to improve an almost unbeatable experience, with an exquisite localization and gameplay, which manages to offer a level of immersion rarely seen before in the open world driving genre.",
"It's an upgrade over the original, but I'm not sure if it's enough of a boost to justify another purchase if you're not a true diehard fan of Hunter the Reckoning. The game does what it set out to do; it just wasn't trying to do too much more than the original.",
"Mugen Souls is a heavily Japanese RPG, with few great ideas and mediocre graphics. The combat system and the nice humour both balance a flat story and the boring space battles. If you like these kind of games, you'll find Mugen Souls funny and enjoying.",
"The basic gameplay concept is fine, and it works as a way to pass time in short bursts. It seems like it could work better if it were a pure skill game rather than the hybrid it is, and it surely would work better on mobile or handheld.",
"You could ask for Darksiders II to be more imaginative, then, and it would be nice to see some sharper puzzles, tighter combat and loftier jumps, but for a game obsessed with revenge and murder Vigil has crafted something with a surprising amount of heart.",
"The colorful adventure is generic in every way except for the graphics, but it should sill be a fun experience for hardcore RPG fans. The world that you explore in real time looks as good as some cut scenes on PS2 RPG’s.",
"It’s clear how much of a labour of love Rainbow Skies was. The game is packed to the brim with mechanics and ideas that call back to a dozen different classic RPGs and strategy games. For all the love that went into the game though, there’s a frustratingly low amount of polish and quality design, especially when it comes to the visuals and writing. Rainbow Skies is a love letter to classic RPGs hastily written in crayon on notebook paper.",
"It both loves and hates the player, and this degree of love or hate depends on the type of player. Some could find its frustrations unforgiveable, while others will delight in its cornucopia of exploratory offerings.",
"I can honestly say that I have a little more respect for the people who do this kind of thing everyday after playing Emergency Fire Response, and great job to Dreamcatcher in making a fun RTS game that captures excitement and enjoyment based on real life people.",
"Firefall quickly wears out its welcome; beaten to the punch by games like Tribes Ascend and the aforementioned Planetside 2. There’s still space for a PvE focused take on open world combat, and in time, this could well fill it. For now though, it’s a few well engineered systems in search of a game that fully deserves them.",
"Total War Saga: Troy takes the Total War franchise to the Bronze Age and while it brings a handful of new changes, Troy is an interesting, but flawed entry in the Total War series.",
"Splashteam's clear love for the allure and allure of platforms, which for the most part is paying off. Great atmosphere that does not go beyond its appeal, amazing level design, smooth controls and an overall aesthetic that is both charming and well integrated, Tinykin from the game and easy to recommend to fans for 2D characters in a 3D atmosphere. . Summing up, I recommend the game to all those who like to explore all the nooks and crannies, turn over all the stones, climb into all the dusty cracks and conquer the tops of bookcases. The game is easy, not straining, but has its own zest.",
"Eventually, the alternation between dull platforming and frustrating adventure just murdered my initial interest in the setting and characters. Insecticide, you won my heart...and then you broke it. But at least you did it quickly.",
"Alan Wake's American Nightmare shows that there is still much to tell about Alan Wake, the character. It's a good glimpse of what may come in the future, and I hope that goes beyond Night Springs episodes for XBLA.",
"Trimming the unnecessary features and focusing on a very specific style of gameplay, it appears to be aimed at a slightly more sophisticated audience than GTA - the oft mentioned ""we know what we want"" crowd.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is just as fun and infuriating as I remember. It’s a content-complete package that celebrates the series. It can feel a bit too limited, with no online play or unlockable characters in minigames, but it’s still a unique experience you can’t get anywhere else.",
"Running around thwacking enemies feels fun enough, but poor A.I. renders your other party member nearly useless - you'll often have to switch between them just to keep them from getting killed. [Feb 2004, p.128]",
"Bonkies is a good enough solo experience that I’ll be more than happy to jump in from time to time whenever I only have a few moments to game, or perhaps as a way to warm up before a night of Warzone or GTA Online. However, you can bet that once I’m able to have people over to my house again, Bonkies will be the first party game of the night that we play. And given its fun factor, possibly the only party game we’ll need.",
"While it may not be the most groundbreaking of shooters, Emergence's merits far outweigh its smattering of faults, and with six to ten hours of entertainment to be had, you can't argue that it's not value for money, especially as it also comes bundled with a copy of the original SiN. Eleven quid you say? Bargain.",
"It’s clear the ‘Saga’ series of Total War has some issues to resolve before titles like Troy can be a success. Their budget and prioritisation in the series is without direction and with something of an identity crisis in a series that already releases annualised big-budget titles. To conclude, Creative Assembly has a lot of work to do in order to refine this class of smaller budget game before it’ll be a successful addition to their roster.",
"All in all, I’m super impressed with Persona 4: Dancing All Night. It essentially hits every high mark when it comes to the rhythm genre, while at the same time delivering a great story with a cast of characters that I certainly love.",
"The game offers incredible boss battles, satisfying combat, and a strong identity within the ""niohlike"" genre, although the level design is overly linear and visually repetitive, yet the overall experience remains highly rewarding and addictive.",
"This samurai action-adventure embraces its contextual tone with a uniquely stellar presentation, a well-paced story, compelling positional and timing-based combat, and a cinematic flair that ties everything together. In all honesty, it's impressive how this game managed to richly condense such an experience within roughly 5 hours. I do wish that some boss fights were more challenging and that Aoki was given more focus, but those points don't take away from how enjoyable, and impactful Trek to Yomi was.",
"Boasting a strong female heroine in Aveline, Assassin's Creed: Liberation is worth the asking price, but only just. The fragmented story was excusable on PS Vita, but on Xbox 360 and PS3, Assassin's Creed: Liberation's myriad cracks and flaws are glaring. Aveline may be a thinly-drawn character, but she's one that's deserving of so much more than this.",
"This episode seems to be lacking quite a bit as far as the storyline and length are concerned. It should supposedly last about three hours, but it seemed even shorter than that to me; much too short, actually.",
The seemingly simple process of having a working camera and an enemy lock-on system has been neglected and as a result we’re left with a ‘nearly’ title – one of those ‘it could have been really good’ situations.,
"NBA 2K23 builds on last year’s rock-solid entry with some well-considered on-court changes, a deeper, more satisfying career mode, and an array of accessible nostalgia-tweaking content. Most refreshingly, almost none of these additions are designed to push extra spending. If Visual Concepts stays hungry, NBA 2K23 could be the beginning of a new dynasty that would do its cover star proud.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2's time-travel plot wallows too much in poorly sketched paradox, but it does offer the opportunity to skip from fantastic world to fantastic world without a care. The greatest benefit is that this outing feels much less linear than its predecessor-players are invited to back away from brick-wall bosses and explore the timeline, gaining strength, gearing up, and chasing new quests at will. The freedom is appreciated.",
"Criminal Girls: Invitation Only is a title with a very, very, very specific audience. RPG fans will find the combat tedious and the plot generic, and those looking for a dose of scantily clad anime girls will probably be turned off by the whipping and electrocution.",
"Lumines: Electronic Symphony is one of those rare games with no end. Sure, you'll end up moving on sometime down the road but for now, you won't find a more addictive puzzle game out there for the Vita; certainly not one with this much intensity and compulsive competition, for yourself and other players. I'd even go as far as recommending a digital purchase so you'll have this game ready to go at all times without having to fumble around for the cartridge.",
"Fun and entertaining with its eclectic mix of indies (never heard any of them if I’m honest), give a miss if you’re searching something that’ll give you a proper run for your money song choice with high BPM songs - since some stretch to a slightly unbearable 70 BPM.",
"Most everyone else will appreciate this slightly faster game with excellent online play and much-improved graphics. The strategic, thoughtful play is still there, but it's not the same Ghost Recon you knew.",
"Nevertheless I have to give BetaDwarf props for trying something different here by mixing up an original blend of genres and for creating something innovative. And although I’m afraid I’m going to have to recommend the original Forced over Showdown any day, I really hope that this team keeps striving to create new and interesting concepts because that is sadly something pretty hard to come by nowadays.",
"Pixel Piracy is a pirate-themed roguelike, pretty basic in its gameplay dynamics and with a good leveling system. The control system is a little bit messy, and so is the interface. Not as deep or replayable as Faster Than Light, though.",
"Dead Kings is free, but is it worth at least the 5/6 hours of gameplay it offers? To an extent, since the new location (at least underground) works as a change from what we're used to, but the gameplay feels a little bit off when enclosed in the maze-like catacombs.",
"A thoughtful update to a classic JRPG that brings it to a whole new audience. With a shiny lick of paint and some fantastic interface changes it’s the best way to experience Shulk, Fiora and Reyn’s epic adventure.",
"A great dating-sim, dungeon-crawler hybrid that takes you on a journey of self-acceptance, love, and facing your fears - all while smooching some cute swords. It’s a short but sweet tale that will leave you wanting more.",
"I was utterly surprised and impressed at how smooth the online matches were, and just how much I enjoyed it overall. For the first of its kind, Burning Skies does a hell of a job replicating the online multiplayer experience found on consoles-complete with lobbies, matchmaking, voice chat via Party, social aspects via Near, and leaderboards.",
"It’s safe to say that We Are OFK won’t be for everyone. As far as interactive narrative adventures go, it’s one of the most passive we’ve encountered, feeling more like an animated TV series than a video game. Add in characters that are difficult to get to know and dialogue that’s likely to grate, and you’ve got an experience that’s tough to recommend. Thankfully, the excellent music videos do offer some redemption, and if you stick with it, you’ll eventually warm to its colourful cast. However you feel about them though, you probably won’t have played anything else quite like this.",
"Vol. 1 still has bouts of incredible monotony, but with the increased speed of the battles and graphics that don't induce nausea, it makes for a fine -- but not really great -- role-playing adventure.",
"NBA 2K23 suffers from an identity crisis. On one hand, it respects basketball fans like no other game ever has in the franchise; on the other, it continues to disrespect NBA 2K players. For every triple, there's a foul; for every fantastic detail in recreating the old NBA eras, there's a microtransaction barrier. A title that does so much right on the court manages to become practically intolerable when trying to play online. Our advice? Cherish the offline.",
"Not much has happened in terms of gameplay. If you've played Dead Island you'll know exactly what to expect, but Riptide still combines RPG elements with an action concept for a nice thrill ride.",
"If you haven't played the original title, you must play Xenoblade Chrinicles: Definitive edition. If you enjoyed this masterpiece of the JRPG you must play this new version, not only for their upgraded graphics, but also for the epilogue. This is a must buy in all the sections.",
"The NBA 2K franchise is back and moving in the right direction. After years of stagnant gameplay mechanics and subtle improvements to its franchise mode, this year’s game has taken huge, direction-defining steps. NBA 2K23 offers an amazingly customizable experience. With the exception of a few perhaps philosophical issues and some lingering old assets still in use, this year’s version registers as an All-NBA first team selection within the series’ storied history.",
The multiplayer maps are gorgeous but tend to be too large for small team battles. Ghost Recon 2 is one of the best shooters of 2004 and a worthy successor to the previous games in the series.,
"Marlow Briggs is not a new experience nor is it original in any way. But the mix of games like Shadowman, Soul Reaver and God of War is well-composed and gives you a decent amount of fun for a reasonable price.",
"Singers hoping for a way to avoid swapping discs from previous Lips games, or some sort of online multiplayer will have to keep waiting, but overall this song pack will keep you crooning for another party.",
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a great excuse to recover two gorgeous platformers without having to tinker with old consoles or spend a fortune. A double remastering of the first two chapters released on PlayStation consoles, perhaps a little too intrusive the one applied on Door to Phantomile, which loses its characteristic 2D pixel art style on 3D modeled backgrounds, but all in all pleasant. Too bad for the lack of care shown for the outline, in particular UI and font of the texts, but it is an excellent birthday present for the 25 years of Klonoa, who after a quarter of a century still proves to be one of the most adorable and iconic from the PlayStation era.",
"It's a game I found myself enjoying in ever shorter bursts as the prospect of farming more XP and Crystite from yet another nest of alien bugs, or finding another lost family member for a crudely modelled NPC, became less and less enticing.",
"FFXIII-2 combines the best of FF XIII (combat and world), and a new, original structure which clearly prompts the player to involve himself in the unraveling of the game. It's sufficiently well-executed and unique to charm most of the fans, even though one comes out of the adventure with a strange feeling. A feeling of a Square Enix who put more focus on exploration and secondary quests than the conclusion of its story or the challenge of its combat. But the freedom feeling that was so absent of the previous game is back there, even though in an unexpected form, and the content is rich. A good game, even though it will not enter the inner circle of the cult Final Fantasy titles.",
"Neon White takes some big swings with its card-shooter/platformer premise and fortunately doesn’t miss. Its execution-heavy action is wildly fast and fun, pushing players to complete complex demon-slaying gauntlets that pepper in exciting twists through the game’s last moments. Levels can feel disappointingly linear and longer stages can drag the momentum down, but the action is largely satisfying from start to finish. That would be enough to make this a worthwhile package, but its surprisingly thoughtful commentary on spirituality and strong late-game hooks make this a game worthy of divine judgment.",
"The replay value is off the map. There is something so cool about playing characters controlled by living, breathing humans. If you haven't tried a persistent online RPG, you're in for an incredible experience.",
There's no better way to keep you busy till the release of Zelda Wii U at the end of the year than The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D. It's perfect from a technical point of view and time seems to have had no impact on this masterpiece.,
"You can't accuse Vergil's Downfall of being more of the same, and Ninja Theory should be commended for offering up a punchy side dish with action that boasts its own distinct flavour.",
"Even after a week of playing it, the trick and combo system just feels like you're cheating the whole time - or being cheated - when what you really want is to feel the thrill of scoring glorious goals, not the smugness of humiliating opponents.",
"Rain Code Plus, despite dragging on a bit too long, is probably my favorite Spike Chunsoft game to date. It has stellar writing that maybe leans too hard into exposition dumps but more often comes together to create a world that is full of depth, populated with interesting characters and lore that flesh the world of Rain Code Plus out in a way that the genre rarely seems capable of. For visual novel fans who may have missed out on the initial switch release, the re-release of Rain Code Plus should not be missed.",
"The formula remains strictly identical to that of the original game and while it is still very enjoyable, we probably would have liked an ounce of madness, a hint of additional risk-taking.",
"Great fun for partying with friends or even for working out alone, Just Dance 2014 delivers a fresh and immediate experience. It only lacks a tutorial mode to better learn every single move: it would have been perfect with it.",
"The gameplay turns mundane as you blast target after target with no real feeling of being the all-powerful Iron Man. Worse yet, it suffers from too many setbacks with its flying and ground combat.",
"Customization, handling, presentation, AI, damage, multiplayer: Forza hits the bull's-eye time after time. Although it doesn't have quite the bewildering range of cars as ""Gran Turismo 4,"" Forza is its equal in gameplay, its superior in AI, and adds the online play ""GT4"" lacked.",
"EA FC 25 is definitely a game of two halves. Its core is still excellent and endlessly enjoyable, and several new additions have given fresh life to the game. However, it remains held back by age-old issues that have plagued the series year-on-year. Overall it offers an improvement over the previous iteration, and Rush, in particular, is an outstanding addition that I hope will become a core part of the game in years to come, but I just wish that painfully slow menus, an abundance of bugs, and sometimes sluggish gameplay wouldn't hold it back.",
"There's much to recommend in Endless Space 2, and its art and writing has the potential to open up a complex genre to a new audience, but there's no escaping the fact it'll be a better game in six months. [Aug 2017, p.116]",
"For its short ambitions, AiRace Xeno delivers…But beyond Time Trials and online leader-boards, there’s very little else this sequel provides. While there are some clear improvements over the original and this game manages to pull the 3DS graphical capabilities very well, the borderline is drawn very close to the starting point and perfectly in line with its very light price tag.",
"The Labo Variety Kit contains five different builds, each with their own intricacies and eccentricities. While the introductory RC Car is a quick 10-minute build, the other four (Motorbike, Piano, Fishing Rod, and House) are much more involved.",
"A well-made and fun game that will put your vocabulary to the test, and at a price of just $5, it's a good buy for Risk and Scrabble fans. It will be especially fun for gamers who have friends online who share their tastes. However, some aspects of this game are quite frustrating, so expect Quarrel to become a pleasant diversion, not an addiction.",
"This game is not a sequel, it has no more about Alan Wake or maintain its gameplay. However, it is fun and frantic, with many weapons and enemies, and some good ideas and lucidity of the engine. Recommended for new players and fans of the writer.",
"The fun factor varies wildly. The story mode is mostly a snooze, composed of 31 short missions ranging from rescuing survivors and clearing out zombie lairs to destroying zombie bosses.",
"It is not a masterpiece, although decent in comparison with the games in the market. The story is powerful, although some flaws both in gameplay and camera control make it just a good try to enjoy.",
"The great sound, variety of characters, deep tactical options, and a neat ability-learning system will ensure that fans of the strategy-RPG genre will not be disappointed. Overall, La Pucelle: Tactics is a well-crafted gem that is clearly a labour of love from Nippon Ichi.",
"The gameday experience remains fantastic and properly replicates the atmosphere, while the changes to AI greatly affect the gameplay. These two additions alone make EA SPORTS FC 25 stand out as one of the best in the series.",
"This game demands quite a lot from you, but if you’re willing to immerse yourself in micro-management and suffer infrequent frustration from a district gone wrong, you’ll find a brilliant old-school city-builder set in one of the most interesting locales imaginable.",
"The third part of the Samorost series is the most memorable. The magical surrealistic world holds great detail and the amazing soundtrack makes the musical gameplay even better. The puzzles require a unique and creative way of thinking, which sometimes makes it hard to continue playing.",
"Although not every aspect of Xenoblade Chronicles has aged as well as others, Definitive Edition proves that Xenoblade Chronicles is still a fantastic JRPG with an immense amount of strategic depth that's still impressive in 2020. Its bevy of improvements and additions, as well as its fantastic epilogue, make this an adventure worth embarking on a decade later.",
The grid-less combat can be annoying to get used to—especially when learning how to properly position characters—but there’s enough small changes to put a good spin on otherwise stale tactical combat.,
"It's the game's bare-bones approach (card battling, deck editing and very little else) that makes WCT 2004 so damn intriguing. Under the simplistic exterior lies a game so laden with strategy and tactics that it makes our brains hurt just thinking about it. [Apr 2004, p.118]",
"Ten years after its initial release in Japan, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition has proven that sometimes classics can still get better with a little extra love and care to make them shine brighter than ever before as a true masterpiece.",
"Appealing to both the intellect and the imagination, it presents itself vividly and audaciously, leaving little doubt that it intends to be a complete experience in every possible way.",
"Popular strip converted to game brings fun mostly to its fans. If you count into this group you will enjoy all adventuring, gags and dialogs. But it takes a lot of patience to get into the heart of the matter if you are new to the stories of Homestar Runner. [Sept 2008]",
"Omen of Sorrow is an efficient and fun fighting game while in the heat of battle, but it trips getting to the arena. Barebones mode selection, a Story Mode that’s clumsy and doesn’t properly pay off, and some strange dialogue throughout keep the game from reaching full potential. The characters are really cool and the fighting system is worth learning, the game does succeed in that regard, but I still am left wanting more. The true Omen isn’t one of Sorrow, it’s one of where’s the rest of the game?",
"Hard West 2 comes with an enjoyably aggressive twist on XCOM-like turn-based combat, and with a fun way of upgrading your characters alongside, but it's wrapped up in world exploration and characterisation that just leaves me wanting to get back in the fight. There’s a lot of fun to be had in Hard West 2, even if it’s not blowing minds as a complete package.",
"It's not hard to see us looking back in five years time and seeing FFXII as a pivotal, changing moment in how RPGs are designed; a game which drew on the experience of Final Fantasy's branches into tactical strategy and massively multiplayer, as well as on the more mature storytelling of other mediums, and folded it back into the number series, to wonderful result.",
"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is best suited for two types of Vita users – those obsessed with the series who can't tolerate having it out of arms reach, or anyone looking for a good fighter who hasn't played it yet. If you've even spent a single night with Capcom's comic crossover, you've already experienced everything the old workhorse has to offer.",
"My main knock against the game is that it can be hard to see the little rolled up Samus, uh, ball at times, particularly during boss fights when the big fellas and their minions are pelting you with rocks or rockets or blast waves or just negative thoughts, and extra particularly when the ball gets hung up in the dead zone between the upper and lower screens.",
"The Urbz has tones of personality and original style which is commended, but the negative vibe of all this style and social status voodoo is that it might be teaching improper stereotypes about certain groups in society.",
"Cliff Bleszinski and the boys at Epic games really outdid themselves. Not only have they addressed the problems of the first game (skimpy story and short campaign mode etc), but the multiplayer additions and new game modes are great and insure the game will be dominating Xbox Live for years to come.",
"A longish Quest mode and lots to unlock offer an extended single-player experience. The multiplayer game is bare bones, though, and the lack of single-cart game sharing is really inexcusable. While Collapse is fun, it lacks the addictive qualities of some of the other match three games.",
"Easily the best game in the Evil Dead video game series (steer away from Hail to the King and Fistfull of Boomstick!). However, this isn't saying much. It has its fair share of flaws, including ""lazy"" graphics, repetitive gameplay, and a glitch-infested level design.",
"If you can ignore the many faults, Venetica can offer a pretty good experience. The story and the collecting of objects and new abilities ensure that you want to keep playing. But even without the little problems that plague the game, Venetica would have never been able to be something truly special.",
"Developing a new title in the sports genre every year and improving at the same time is a real challenge for any company, but Visual Concepts managed to create a true 9th generation experience with NBA 2K23, offering solid visuals, stunning animations and tons of content while staying loyal to simulation gameplay. It is safe to say that the king is back.",
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is the best attempt yet by Sega to get back to the brilliance that was the original games. While purists will still feel just a little off at the game's physics, everyone else probably won't notice. With the stack of party games, things to unlock and almost near infinite replayability, Banana Manaia will be something you return to repeatedly. We've all been begging for a remake of Super Monkey Ball. We've finally got, and while it's not perfect – really what is?",
"Namco Museum is a testament to just how far along handheld games have come since the days of overpriced Game Boy Color ports. With challenge modes, online leaderboards, a unique use of the Switch hardware and the most accessible versions of Splatterhouse and Pac-Man Vs. ever, Namco Museum is a surprisingly strong package. It might not offer enough incentive for fans that have revisited these games ad nauseam, and some offerings holdup a lot better than others, but the compilation offers perhaps the best way for passionate fans to revisit a handful of classics.",
"I didn’t have the pleasure of playing Alwa’s Legacy’s title before this (Alwa’s Awakening), but I can say with confidence and un-tinted goggles, Alwa’s Legacy is a fantastic game that can be picked up regardless of your experience with the series. It has an exciting, challenging, and rewarding playstyle that’s accentuated by a beautifully crafted and nostalgic world. What more could you ask for? There’s just so much obvious love and care that has been poured into this game from its developers, and it really gives Alwa’s Legacy a glossy polish that is unfortunately missing from a lot of other metroidvania indie titles we see today. Would I recommend Alwa’s Legacy? Yes, a hundred times over, yes. It is fun from the very beginning to end, and invites you to explore the contents of its world without hand-holding or a curfew to pull you down.",
"I appreciate that they expanded the tricks, and added some real players to the mix. And the new Gamebreaker is nice. But overall the trick controls are just as difficult, if not more, than the first game. And not having online gameplay is a big big big issue for me.",
"Concord is by no means a disaster and has the potential to grow into a compelling hero shooter. But a thin selection of modes, characters who leave a weak impression, and a misguided overabundance of lore make it a hard sell currently.",
"Sunlight is certainly not for everyone, with a niche place as an art game more akin to Flower or Mountain than even other walking simulators. Nonetheless it's something that certainly will find a home and has a definite impact. Given what we’ve seen in the world in 2020 and the start of 2021, this little moment of peace is much needed.",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 features three solid entries into the Kingdom Hearts series and, while there’s plenty of setup for the future, what’s here is mostly fantastic. Back Cover might be the weak point of this collection, but even that is worth checking out if you’re really into the crazy lore in this series. Simply put, Kingdom Hearts in 60FPS is wonderful and the little taste of Kingdom Hearts 3 is even better than I had hoped.",
"Splatoon 2 may not reach the same heights of the previous game in terms of originality, however it’s still a worthy sequel that does enhance the overall experience of this franchise. The single-player is a treat, however where Splatoon 2 shines is via its multiplayer mode that is pure chaos from the get go. With both ranked and unranked matches, Splatoon 2’s multiplayer is thoroughly entertaining and gives players from around the world the chance to engage in some competitive fun as you level up your Avatar while shooting your coloured ink in a variety of ways which is pure ingenious fun.",
"As the first showing for Polygon Treehouse, Röki is an incredible first impression. While it doesn’t innovate much within the genre itself, it excels in the areas that matter, and it absolutely delivers the kind of experience you would be looking for from an adventure game.",
"American Nightmare is good value, but it hints at more than it delivers - a world in which urban myths can come true never materialises in this episode. But that just makes us wonder what Remedy has got in store.",
"NBA 2K23 is the game the community has been wanting, but that hardcore community is far more advanced than any casual player looking to just play a basketball game. It’s the little things that help to make NBA 2K23 the best sports representation to date, and the legacy content now puts the series far ahead of any other sports series out there. It’s not without its fault, beginning with the difficulty and learning curve of the game. Every bit of content in this year’s game is fresh and useful and you’ll find yourself playing every mode. If you purchased the version that offers 100K virtual currency, you have to choose if that’s going to MyPLAYER or to MyTEAM. The modes remain a grind to keep the player on the game, but the Jordan Challenge is worth the price of admission to begin with. This is better than the 2K Showcases in the WWE series due to the presentation aspect. It’ll be difficult for 2K to one-up NBA 2K23, one of the best video game sports adaptions of all time.",
"And, of course, there's the music. Which, as we've already is discussed, is awesome. The fight to have this music piped through every PA, loudspeaker and radio station in Britain begins now. Viva la revolution.",
"Don’t expect any revolutionary changes to the two year old PC release. But with added content, optimized controls and a solid core throughout you’ll find yourself spending more time on these islands than originally expected.",
"Single-player falls down only by virtue of the fact that repetition of missions is crucial to progress, although with such a clear multiplayer focus, it's no surprise that this is the highlight. [June 2009, p.120]",
"While Liberation offers AC junkies some elements that will keep them happy for up to 15 hours, the game ultimately lacks coherent storytelling, interesting missions and memorable characters.",
"Despite its impressive audiovisual presentation, it fails in the areas that make a game a game. It is beautiful in its own dismal way, and the story it tells is decent, but I could not wait for it to end so I would not have to deal with the frustrating control and dull design decisions.",
"It's a shame the innovative DS touch screen is hardly used here - play only requires use of the directional pad and buttons. The cat-and-mouse action is still as addictive as ever, but the new changes are not that innovative.",
"Those looking for a reboot of Ridge Racer or for something which may resemble the iconic Namco Bandai series will become dissapointed, but anyway Unbounded is a good racing game, which control you may love or hate, a bit limited in single player content but with a great potential for used-created content in the multiplayer mode.",
"Gears of War 2 is a fantastic game, with an epic campaign, incredible Horde co-op experience, and improved multiplayer; all in a package that promises to keep players entertained for dozens, if not hundreds of hours. Several issues keep the game from being all it could be, but it remains a worthy addition to any 360 owner's library.",
"If you have been a longtime fan of Don’t Nod’s repertoire of games, then Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a great addition to the studio’s titles. However, the narrative sets up more than it answers in part one, making the experience frustrating by the time it’s over. For the start of the Lost Records universe, “Bloom” presents incredible scenery amidst a lukewarm story driven by self-discovery and mystery. In the end, the game doesn’t capture the full sunset of what is to come but sets up a story that has the potential to show its true colors.",
"There's a hellish amount of ""..."", even by J-RPG standards, and many sentences don't quite make sense - it's either a poorly written game, a crap translation to English or, probably, both.",
If you enjoy Onimusha then I'd recommend getting the remaster of Onimusha Warlords. It's really annoying that the game doesn't include the Genma Onimusha content but the 3D movement controls work very well for the type of gameplay that Onimusha has.,
"With the BioShock atmosphere, the Firewatch narrative design, and a glimpse of Outlast, Close to the Sun is a medley that works from an esthetic and lore side but sometimes lacks of polish on a more technical and gameplay side. Plus, the game is really short (4/5 hours).",
"Stock animation generates the same A.I. moves over and over again. This redundant theme is further exacerbated by the gameplay which, despite changing environments, doesn't differ from mission to mission.",
"I still have major concerns about the game's combat, but Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a good history lesson for what inspired me and so many others to love RTS genre so much. It’s a brilliant game with a ton of content and for such a low entry price, I think it’s worth a look even if it’s not perfect.",
"For all its clumsy new baggage and rushed feel, Homeworld 2 takes itself seriously, designed from the ground up as a reward to the faithful rather than an olive branch to the casual newcomer. [Dec 2003, p.84]",
"Too average of an adventure game to be interesting. The uninteresting story and gameplay are disappointing, especially since the game is based off such a popular franchise as Neopets.",
"A conventional, by-the-numbers shooter that just about stands out for its enjoyable firefights, in both single and multiplayer, and for being the first handheld FPS to really work.",
"This career mode-intensive cycle-racer does a great job of taking gamers through a variety of Ducati-brand bikes (new and vintage), along with plenty of impressive challenges and races.",
"Those Who Remain can work if you are looking for simple scares.The atmosphere works well and puzzles are based on some very good concepts. But the rest of the elements simple ruin the experience, even when the game tries it hard to include story choices to be more complex. With so many other similar and better games out there, there is no reason to recommend it.",
"While lacking a true single player component (at least for the moment) and with some bugs and glitches still to patch, the new war simulator by Bohemia Interactive will capture hardcore gamers with a massive, vast, complex and layered new episode.",
"A little bit funnier and even more ""minecraft-like"" than the first episode, but in comparison to other Telltale productions it is still the weakest link. The second episode is also extremely short.",
"But the one thing that can&#146;t be overlooked is that the game is over way too soon...(but) lives up to the engine it&#146;s built on &#150; it&#146;s a great companion to ""THPS2.""",
"If you're simply looking for some quick jump-scares, then Those Who Remain is an adequate choice, but there are likely dozens of games on Steam or Itch.io that are better and less expensive than this.",
"In spite of its flaws, Ontamarama is a solid rhythm game that will appeal to gamers who haven't had much to groove to on DS since last year's ""Elite Beat Agents"". [Holiday 2007, p.86]",
"It’s hard to believe this is a game that released in 2012 and not more recently. Though there are some dated and heavy systems, the atmosphere and a combat system that gives freedom and depth make Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition an RPG for the ages.",
"The saving grace is Hellbound‘s price. At just £11.39/$14.99, it’s not terrible value for money. But there are better old-school first-person shooters available for not much more. Still, there’s a good few hours of fun to get from Hellbound‘s campaign. Maybe even more if you’re the type that wants to discover every secret and beat every par time. And the game’s survival maps offer yet more hours of gameplay. It’s just a shame that it feels more like a starter than a main course.",
"American Nightmare isn't just a fantastic game that packs a ton of content inside a budget price, it's also a look into the exciting future of Alan Wake. I hope this isn't Alan's only assault on the arcade, because American Nightmare is good fun, and the Fight til Dawn mode is a welcome addition to the series.",
"Filling in a family tree may not sound all that compelling, but digging up the sordid secrets of a prominent family of celebs is such voyeuristic fun that it’s hard to tear yourself away from The Roottrees Are Dead until not one but two sets of mysteries are solved in this polished and expanded commercial remake.",
"Despite its childish look, Pikuniku tells us a revolutionary tale of a random guy joining a resistance group fighting against an evil corporation. Funny until the end, Devolver's new game may mostly count on its strange physics, even to the point of frustration when the game asks for strong platformer parts. The two-player mode might balance a very short length though.",
"While it might not be groundbreaking, this game has style and a developer that is capable of showing off what he can do &#150; and that's more than enough to redefine space RTS games once more.",
"Supreme fan service, an epic sense of scale and plenty of gameplay variety ensure that Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is not only an unreservedly brilliant sequel, but is inarguably the best Transformers game we've played.",
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a good game, and it’s absolutely fine fare if you don’t already own a version of Taito’s venerable series. The new quirks don’t break anything fundamental, and that’s for the best in terms of maintaining series quality. At the same time, the new modes don’t add a lot.",
An insanely hard game. Beating the game will require intimate knowledge of the levels and a mastery of the controls. The title is a breath of fresh air in today's environment of games that can be easily polished off.,
"Frogwares doubles down on the interactive mystery format of the last game with a more lavish outing featuring newly charming leads. The story's tremendously entertaining. [Aug 2016, p.82]",
"In truth, it's an average game, with the music and the presentation proposing a more dramatic and meaningful experience than is actually manifested in the gameplay. [Issue#150, p.118]",
"Metroid Prime Pinball fills the void for a portable pinball machine. If you are looking for a pinball game that is fun and challenging, MPP would be a good addition to your DS game library.",
"A fast-paced, well playing fighter that makes few concessions on the Vita. While the game's modes are pretty sparse and the new touch mode is a dud, there's still a lot to be excited about if you're a fighting fan with a brand new Vita.",
"The performance was solid throughout my testing, I had no issues with gameplay improvements and the graphics looked great. There were some pathfinding issues and units did enjoy clashing with one another, which made battle rather hectic, but the clunky controls and movement were among the things I loved most about the original.",
"What really counts here is the gameplay, and in that sense, Regeneration is a fitting tribute to the films. It's great, gory fun to hack limbs off your Deadite foes, and the targeting and combo system are up to the challenge...even if the camera angles suffer from time to time.",
"If you can see past its dull story and some uninspired art direction, what remains of Once Human is a profoundly compelling shared-world survival game. It’s a moreish riot of perilous progression and deep customisation, more than capable of keeping you entertained for months, and maybe years, to come.",
"Iro Hero is a decent game with a poorly thought-out execution. The game is difficult but almost unforgiving, as longer-than-usual levels and a high enemy count mean you'll start at the beginning of stages far more often than you'd like. The mechanics are barely explained in-game due to the ill-conceived layout, and the story suffers the same fate as well. With an inconsistent presentation to boot, Iro Hero is a game that's solely for hardcore genre fans, as everyone else will barely make it out of the first stage before deleting it in favor of other, better-executed shooters.",
"Once you get to grips with its demands, Rollerdrome’s core concept is realised immaculately. With glorious backup from its retro stylings, each run is peppered with audacious stunts that would grace any action movie. It flags towards the end, however, thanks to an inelegant pile-on of difficulty, a lack of new twists, and disregard for its character’s story and narrative themes.",
"Resistance Burning Skies made us angry: expectations were high, and not all were disappointed, but the general impression is that with greater care and attention to detail, it could have easily become a must buy, bolstered by a well-designed control system, a large arsenal and a funny multiplayer. As it stands, however, is only recommended for fans of the genre or of the Resistance brand.",
"The Thaumaturge is stuffed with ideas that sound great on paper, but the end result may have bitten off more than it can chew, as a lot of its concepts feel undercooked without delivering on their grandiose aims.",
"Old Gods Rising is an unfortunate mess. While it has a story that immediately hooks the player, a world that’s begging to be explored and understood, and boasts fantastic environmental sound design, the current state of the game is unplayable. The numerous bugs and glitches restrict this game from being a great title. Until those bugs are patched out, you’re better off spending your money elsewhere.",
"Motorcycle-specific racing fantatics will lose themselves in MotoGP's depth of details, but most gamers will find the practice-requisite experience an oddly passionless grind. [Dec 2008, p.89]",
"What do you get when you put together solid controls, a fun story, great action, beautiful graphics, and a game oozing with character? Jak II, one of the best PS2 games of the year.",
"Ridge Racer Unbounded might not be the Ridge Racer game your dad played back in his day, but don't let the name fool you. It's dark and dirty visual style is second only to the dirty and explosive racing action that awaits when you strap in behind the wheel of this addictive arcade racer where the only limit to your fun is your imagination.",
"With more battle tracks, a few more actual racetracks and four-player Grand Prix mode - and let us not forget Internet play, for those of us who will never have all the equipment to make use that tantalising LAN mode - Double Dash would almost certainly qualify for the top score. As it is, at times it's a hair's breadth away, and you're doing yourself a massive disservice if you don't race out and buy this the second it's available.",
"Rising is one hell of a rollercoaster ride that all Metal Gear fans should definitely play, but more than a decade after MGS2, it turns out that I’m still frustrated in the role of Raiden. But this time, it’s simply because the game doesn’t quite unleash his full potential.",
"The game is unpretentious and makes no apologies for being exactly what it wants to be - and that is a game with a beautifully crafted storyline, intriguing characters, plenty of humour, and everything you want from an RPG. Forget the naysayers, this is really a class act.",
Ronin is an interesting and stylish ninja game based on interesting and original strategy mechanics. The game is flawed by a trial and error difficulty level design and an unforgiving and unrefined checkpoint system.,
"If you only have the Xbox 360 as your console, MLB 2K6 does play a fairly solid game of baseball, provided you have all your sliders in place. But for me, the best baseball game again this year is still 989's ""MLB 06: The Show.""",
"Tropico 3 has turned out to be a nice management sim that fans of the genre will love. The gameplay mechanics are elaborate, the economic and political systems are well done and it looks like a charm. The micromanagement can be annoying due to lack of information, but luckily it's never entirely frustrating. Looking for a good sim? Tropico 3 is definitely not a bad choice.",
"A huge amount of CRUSH is brilliantly playable and consistently enjoyable. It is bursting with character by puzzle game standards and, even considering its shortcomings, is still a PSP release well worth picking up if you are looking for something fresh and stimulating.",
"New spells and powers don’t mean much once you hop into the game’s single-player campaign, as the action is still mash, mash, mash, mash. The level design is just as it has always been, meaning twisting labyrinth after twisting labyrinth filled with hordes of mindless enemies.",
"Super Princess Peach is a platform game taken straight off a Nintendo blueprint; it has the charm and simplicity reminiscent of the “good old days” and yet remains fresh thanks to solid, original gameplay.",
"While Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue suffers from Square’s scattershot approach to what has been included in the collection, it nevertheless remains a must-have for Kingdom Hearts fans, especially those who didn’t have access to Dream Drop Distance the first time around because of the franchise’s odd migration to and from Sony and Nintendo devices seemingly at a whim.",
"A fantastic game. Not just a step in the right direction, but an unequivocal success. In fact, it's the best entry in the series since the Blue Blur's 16-bit heyday. [Dec 2010, p.78]",
"It combines some simple concepts, throws them in a co-op pot, adds connectivity, removes nasty bugs and, instead of salt and pepper, it sprinkles a budget price on top. The only catch, you have to bring some buddies along with you. [June 2013]",
"The puzzling, while fearsomely inventive and effortlessly pleasurable, unfortunately doesn't fulfil its obvious potential. But if you are possessed by Ghost Trick's charms, you will find an affecting, charismatic game with a whole lot of spirit.",
"The Roottrees are Dead is a great video game for any players who like experiences like Obra Din or the two Golden Idol titles. It feels good to investigate, starting with a list of names, and reveal the rich history of an entire family. The feeling that there’s something more to learn, to understand, is always present and the game has a decent hint system to help players who get stuck. As cool as the feeling of discovery is, the game is limited in terms of mechanics. Players search for text strings, read results, and make connections. The cool soundtrack helps with immersion, but the loop can become repetitive after one or two hours. The Roottrees are Dead is unlikely to draw new players to the deduction genre but has all the ingredients needed to keep fans engaged in the long run.",
"A clear improvement over its predecessor. The story is better told, and you'll have a lot more freedom in how you choose to approach the game. Final Fantasy fans will find plenty to enjoy here.",
"Poor signposting is a problem throughout, compounding frustration in by-the-numbers stealth/chase sequences (though each of these is mercifully to the point once you figure out what you’re supposed to do). Bright spots, such as the early story’s compassionate portrayal of childhood bereavement and some genuinely unsettling sound design, are too often overshadowed. We’re not leaving the light on for this. [Issue#177, p.156]",
"A fantastic game. I thoroughly enjoyed spelunking through the game’s massive world, and even though the story can get lackluster, it does excel when it tackles its religious themes.",
"A perfect example of how to make a remake. Treasure has achieved an update that faithfully respects the original game, but also adds enough improvements to become a really must-have game for the nostalgic gamers. Although its particular gameplay might turn off newcomer, they should give it a chance at least.",
"With around a 10-hour runtime – although your mileage may differ depending how quickly you deal with the game’s tougher puzzles – Röki is a delight from start to finish. It’s hard to put down; its story and characters encapsulate you in their magical world right from the get-go. As you play, it’s hard to shake the feeling that you’ve uncovered something really special; and considering Röki is the first game from Polygon Treehouse, it leaves me very excited to see what comes next.",
"The story mode is too short but the challenges and multiplayer options make up for it. Although it's not a massive improvement over TimeSplitters 2, it is definitely just as good in terms of pure entertainment.",
"As a big Diablo 2 fan, Resurrected has let me down in many ways. What little changes have been made to the original formula are welcome, but feel like leftover bread crumbs from a larger pie that could have been. Diablo 2 was in a bit of a weird place in that it was not hard at all to access and play the original game, even on modern PC hardware. This new release does make the game available to console audiences, which is an awesome change, but the lack of crossplay really hurts here. Resurrected could end up becoming a much better value down the road as the development team begins introducing updates and upgrades, but as of right now, you should avoid this package unless you are happy with straight-up Diablo 2. That being said, there are many reasons to be thrilled to revisit the game, particularly for the timeless soundtrack and to get a glance at the spiffy new paint job. Just make sure to set your expectations accordingly.",
"In its current state, Railgrade is an easy recommendation if you enjoy trains and logistical puzzles. Just don’t come into this expecting a simulation-focused experience. I never played Railgrade before the Steam version so can’t comment on what changed or improved, but I see myself dipping into the game regularly over the coming months as a nice relaxing experience. The shorter mission structure also perfectly suits the pick up and play nature of the Steam Deck.",
"While Drakensang easily exceeds any expectations regarding presentation and scope, the finer points of RPG design - notably combat and player-driven interactions with the game world - are lost on the game. [Mar 2009, p.92]",
Brings the political and economical facets of running your own little island to life with vivid colors and tropical music. The game also adds a lot of humor and stays true to the original game.,
"Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars isn't a bad game, but it hardly feels like a full new game either. It's more like an enhanced expansion pack, with more units, better (but not amazing) graphics and a new storyline.",
"As a title which mixes adventure elements with beat'em up side scrolling combat, ""Little Witch Academia"" shows as a title which is appealing for the series fans but also becomes an interesting game for those who want an alternative in the genre.",
"We Are OFK is an incredibly well-written game that stretches the boundaries of the medium. There's not a lot of traditional gameplay, but the characters are so well-realised and the writing so strong that even though there’s not much for you to do during each of the episodes, the act of being there and listening remains highly engaging. Between the strong art and soundtrack, there’s a lot to like, even if there’s not a lot to play.",
"Ghost Song is the perfect mix of Metroid and Hollow Knight, creating a gorgeous-looking game full of exploration, a great story, and a creepy atmosphere. If you like Metroidvania-style games, make sure you check out this title!",
"The wait for Tape 2 is going to be a long one, because Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Tape 1 has me utterly hooked. It perfectly captures the highs and lows of being a teenage girl, brought to life with a cast of characters that feel as real as your childhood friends. While it's a slow burn, and most of the game's major secrets will (hopefully) unravel in Tape 2, this is still an absolute must-play for any fans of the narrative adventure genre.",
"Gameplay that constantly changes with each weapon you pick up and challenges galore, especially in the arena. The presentation is also top notch, a true sign of dedication from Joe ""Mad"" Maduriera and his team.",
"Rock Band 3 continues to delight my gaming senses and eardrums, and I look forward in watching my wallet deplete of funds with new DLC songs and instrument options on down the line.",
Sorry We’re Closed is a divine contender for best adaptation of nostalgic ‘90s gaming while reaching the tier of 2010s handheld era titles. A must-have and a must-want for anyone without a PC.,
"To each their own of course, but this game's developers probably could have put a bit more effort into Gallop Racer 2006 in order to make it more accessible for people who are curious, or just think the idea of a racing game with horses is cool. As someone who feels just like that, I can respect what Gallop Racer 2006 is about, but I'm a little disappointed too.",
"With its interesting setting that combines the Old West with supernatural and occult elements and solid tactical turn-based combat with excellent pacing, Hard West 2 is a worthy purchase for fans of the genre. However, balancing issues, limited character customization, which force players to play in specific ways, and a general streamlining of the tactical combat experience make the game more shallow than expected, inevitably turning off some veterans of the genre.",
American role-playing veterans who aren't absolutely dying to do turn-based battles on their shiny new console are advised to wait for a true RPG killer app on 360 -- however long that's going to take.,
"Considering there have been so few western action games over the last dozen years or so, anyone who's a fan of this style owes it to themselves to at least give Call of Juarez a shot.",
"If you were a fan of the first and didn’t get bored of the repetitive zombie slaying you might enjoy your stay on Palanai, but I’m willing to put money on most players giving up after only a few hours into the game.",
"In conclusion, we can only invite you to play New Super Mario Bros. Wii. We will move into the new magic game signed by Nintendo. Those who feared a sacrifice of quality for multiplayer options will find their fears unfounded. The title is probably the best episode in series, a great product for multiplayer and a milestone in the Wii catalog.",
"Dead or School is a game with limited budget, and that sings from afar: animations, videos, repetitive backgrounds... lots of things could be better. But the important, its metroidvania gameplay it's fun and systems like the weapon upgrade are deep and works better. Add a craziness layer, and you've got a simple but enjoyable game.",
"Everspace is an unusual and well-designed roguelite, respectful of the genre and, at the same time, trying to create a fascinating space odyssey. Definitely worth a look, but only if you're a fan of the genre.",
The strategic card selection and management combined with satisfying action makes for an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I enjoyed seeing my character slowly become more powerful as you gain better cards that will help you progress further.,
"An over-complicated story with pacing issues holds this RPG back from its full potential, especially since the prequel was not released in English first. Those who enjoy reading will no doubt have fun. A tedious magic leveling system can also scare away new fans embracing the series. Only RPG diehards and TK fans will immediately gravitate towards it.",
"This is the first time that the MotoGP licence has been in the hands of Capcom as publishers and Milestone as developers. The result is a solid game that doesn't really improve on last year's offering. By setting its sights on accessibility, MotoGP 08 seems to lose its focus on who it's for and ends up providing something for everyone but not everything for anyone.",
"After playing this game, I don't think I will even think I'll ever lay eyes on rollercoaster tycoon again even if it did just launch onto the Xbox not to long ago. I think I will stick with this game.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is grand in the way you don't see that often in video games. It can surprise the way only the creators of indie games can. It has perfect gameplay, superb story, amazing scale and lots of emotion. It really is a great, grand game.",
"In essence, if you absolutely loved the film to bits and absolutely must have an Iron Man game to go with it, then Sega have done as good a job as they can of producing a playable version of the movie.",
"Immortals Fenyx Rising: Myths of the Eastern Realm gives us a fresh protagonist, a completely new setting, familiar mechanics and a few new tricks. With fantastic logic puzzles and the same tight combat as the base game, Myths of the Eastern Realm represents a great new way to experience everything we loved from the original. Let’s hope Ubisoft continues to take risks like this as they seem to pay off in a big way.",
"The game felt easier just because of the fact that it holds your hand throughout the journey, and acts like a set of training wheels until the end. That doesn't mean the game isn't fun though.",
"Most of Turok 2: Seeds of Evil’s problems simply lie with the passage of time. If you are willing to overlook some of those issues, such as the outdated visuals and level design, what you will find is a fun and thrilling trip down memory lane to one of the Nintendo 64’s best first-person shooters. The lack of multiplayer, while not essential, hurts the overall package.",
"With around 40 mini-games included Raving Rabbids: Alive & Kicking, the biggest highlight of this game is how well some of these games work, especially with the Kinect controller which has copped some flack over the last year.",
"Despite a lackluster story and some unnecessary new obstacles, its large playable area and unique underground locations give you lots of opportunities to use its explosive new weaponry, hone your stealth or combat skills or simply experience more of what you enjoyed about Unity’s original release.",
"For every well done aspect of Need for Speed Unbound, there are two or three that leave something to be desired. The narrative doesn't have to be the main focus, but it's lazily done, via offscreen dialogue that takes place while you're in the menu. The new Takeover events don't deliver the fun they promise, and the police chases leave much to be desired, but the core gameplay, along with the soundtrack and vehicle customisation, is so good that there are moments when you forget all about it. At 300km/h, it all gets a bit blurry, doesn't it?",
"Gears of War 2 takes the formula established by the original and polishes it to great effect. Everything from the pacing of the campaign, tuned difficulty, added weapons and enemies, and slew of multiplayer options demonstrates mastery in design that all action games aspire, yet precious few achieve. Not everything is rosy--chalk the poor story and lame characters as being yet another victim of cheesy game writing. That's excusable, though.",
"Himalaya Studios honed their skills with their popular remakes of ""King's Quest"" I and II. With Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine they show that they also have what it takes to create a successful original work.",
"Firefall showed some real promise as I started on my epic journey. The shooting was fine, and the missions were fun at first, but then after doing almost the same thing over and over again, I just couldn't find any reason to continue. Like I said, I am willing to go back and see if the game improves in the future but I wont be returning to Firefall anytime soon.",
"In isolation it's a great racing game, but in the context of the dreaded yearly churn to which Codemasters finds itself committed, the sensational but ultimately restrictive Classics Mode is the only meaningful addition.",
"Witch-King may not leave that same sense of wonder as when the original Battle for Middle-earth II launched, but it is – nonetheless – a challenging game that offers a new look at the rich tapestry of Tolkien’s world.",
"It's clear from the start that Liberation HD is a remake of a Vita-game. Some mechanics are really interesting tough, like the costume-system, but are on the other hand poorly implemented. At the end of the day it's an interesting, but lesser Assassin's Creed.",
"Disney and Pixar have a cash cow phenomenon on their hands that is well deserved. This is what makes the game’s mediocrity all the more infuriating. Aside from the authentic look of the title, and perhaps also the jazzy and bombastic tunes, The Incredibles disappoints on every other level.",
"It's an entertaining attempt to revive an old favorite without straying too far from what made it so good in the first place. It's not the most impressive game you'll see on DS this fall, but it's one of the most fun.",
"Despite the new enemies and other additions, Dead Island: Riptide feels too much like more of the same. Techland had the opportunity to fix many of the flaws of the first game - bad story, technical glitches, repetitiveness - but they did almost nothing about it.",
"The shooting is top notch, but poor pacing and bland environments ensure you never engage with what's going on, and technical hiccups and formulaic game modes sour the multiplayer. This game proves the potential power of the genre on its device, but not the potential excellence of its own franchise.",
"It’s still the same brilliant game but this time available on a console that you can take anywhere with you. I expected more, but it turned out that it’s enough for me. [09/2017, p.54]",
"Röki’s castle segment isn’t catastrophic, but it delivered far less in narrative impact and far more in adventure-game twitchiness than the forest, which was almost perfect. In the woods, Röki is a delight, blending whimsy and sorrow into a splendid modern adventure. In the castle, it is simply ordinary, and as a result of these two unbalanced halves, Röki never quite delivers on its early promise.",
"The biggest problem with Evil Dead: Regeneration isn't that it's not simple fun, but that it never rises above that in any way that Evil Dead fans might hope, or that comedy-horror genre fans might expect.",
"To shallow for teens or adults, too overwhelming for kids, and too mind-numbingly repetitive for everyone, How to Train Your Dragon sets the bar pretty average for the rest of the movie license line-up coming this year.",
"To call South of Midnight a ‘perfect’ Game Pass title would be disrespectful because the reality is that our industry has become obsessed with bloated experiences, and it’s led us to believe that anything less isn’t worth paying for – at least at full price. The truth though, is that we need more creatives being just that, and South of Midnight is part of Xbox’s supposed plans to let its developers cook. We just have to hope that the kitchen doesn’t close when service is over, because we need developers like Compulsion Games to make games like South of Midnight – shorter experiences that tell new and exciting stories set in immersive worlds, even if the gameplay feels familiar, because nothing beats a good story.",
"While it has a few things going for it like its pretty look and the fact that it's the only cycle game available for the system, its overall difficulty level and its lack of variety in circuits and gameplay modes drag it down.",
"Ikenfell is a game of good intentions. The take on RPG combat is both satisfying and interesting with enough options, both with in-game tweaks to characters and strategy and also directly within the settings, to help tailor it to your preferences. It just drags on a bit without feeling like anything has actually really happened until its final moments. The nice variety and wholesome vibes present a lovely little world to explore and save. There are just enough little pitfalls in the story and execution that can be quite grating when I wanted to feel immersed.",
"Little Witch Academia is a game that is aimed at the series fans first and foremost. It is hard to recommend this game to anyone else because of its bland environments and repetitive events, despite some unique designs that we liked.",
"Despite this, much of the game is a joy to play, providing more than its share of simple, disposable fun. Moreover, Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai nails the spirit of its protagonist and the atmosphere of the adventure. Although its scenario is silly and many of its incidents are ridiculous, the game succeeds because it never takes itself very seriously.",
"But to the non-fans, is this game fun? Kind of, for a short time then the repetitiveness of it sets in and you'll be plowing through trying to get your moneys worth of this budget title.",
"Paleo Pines is a life simulator game with a twist: dinosaurs. With a wonderful setting, excellent visuals, and a catchy and charming soundtrack, the game offers a peaceful and pleasant gaming experience to put the world on hold.",
"The devil may indeed be in the details, but if you dive into Freedom with the mind-set of ""knowing is half the battle,"" you'll be rewarded with a game that will provide you with--no lie--over 100 hours of truly compelling gameplay. [Jun 2006, p.100]",
"Switch owners may be more comfortable with playing older games than Nintendo’s less portable cousins, but even this feels a bit too short-lived and dated to satisfy our Capcom cravings, especially when there are more exciting oldies to come to Switch, from Resident Evil 4 to the recently announced Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen.",
"Its cute world and phone-ready puzzles are perfect for kids around the age of 8, but anyone who is sucked into playing with them will find themselves bored after a few stages. The most puzzle-obsessed of gamers should set their sights on something a bit more complicated and adult.",
"The pacing is bad, the activities are boring, the Vision Camera is an annoyance and handcuffs the entire experience, and the payoff for all of your hardships isn’t fulfilling in the slightest.",
"Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a turn-based strategy game that hails traditionalism and old design values. It is true to its predecessors, and fans won`t be disappointed despite the fact that it in many ways lacks evolution in gameplay and core mechanics.",
"The real strength of Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is how expertly High Moon leverages the characters and mythology to create a cinematic shooter that stands on the strength of its design and gameplay, rather than leaning on its license as a crutch.",
"One of the biggest drawbacks of Mana is the story. Any RPG&#151;especially any RPG made in this day and age&#151;had better have a great story if it&#146;s going to keep your attention. But Mana&#146;s tale is lacking conflict, its characters are dull, and its towns are full of&#133;well, not all that much interesting.",
This sequel feels like a huge expansion. The game doesn't really offer anything new apart from a few new zombies and weapons. It has a lot of bugs and suffers from frame drops when things get busy.,
"An irresistible little charmer. It's short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome, clever enough to be engaging, full of enough action to be consistently fun. Fans of the film series will, of course, want to grab it, but action gamers looking for a dose of sarcasm, zombie guts, and light puzzles will find themselves amused as well.",
"Easily Mistwalker's best game so far and another sure sign that, with a bold enough creator, Japanese role-players can be just as exciting and innovative as their Western counterparts.",
"With so much to like about Knights and Bikes, finding things to complain about wasn’t easy. One thing that came to mind is that the fifth chapter takes considerably more time to complete than the others, and at times seems to drag. However, the rest of the adventure has excellent pacing. I also had a small issue with the ending. There’s a twist that’s hinted at shortly before it unfurls, but this foreshadowing would have had greater impact if was built up earlier instead of appearing so close to the finale. Otherwise, I have no issues with this incredibly well-written story. Knights and Bikes is an adorable little treasure worth finding.",
"he games really just have not aged well at all, and the terrible up-and-down of the matches to get you to pump tokens into the game still remain, making it an incredibly frustrating fight.",
"This is a title aimed at players who want a peaceful adventure, where exploring is the key. If you're a more experience player looking for something challenging or deep, you might have to look elsewhere.",
"While the inclusion of the Race for the Heisman mode was an incredibly ambitious move, along with some of the other tweaks made to the game, NCAA Football 06 manages to carry them off rather well.",
"With its ludicrous storyline and its super-cool characters, Ghost Trick blows a fresh wind on DS adventure games. Its designers undoubtedly loved making it. Capcom didn't lie on the goods. After a brilliant success like Phoenix Wright, its designers have done it again. Congrats.",
"Grip: Combat Racing offers an enormous amount of fun content for a reasonable price. Frankly, this game could go toe to toe with a lot of AAA racers and come out on top. Blistering speed, amazing track design, wild action; if you can get past some mild frustrations, Grip fully delivers and intense, jaw-clenching good time.",
"With simple, intuitive controls making combat and exploration a pleasure, what starts off as a fairly routine blade-swishing blizzard soon settles into a more interesting groove. With secret-packed levels offering countless opportunities to poke around, it's a formula that's familiar but satisfying.",
"All the elements of a great game are here: gorgeous graphics, stellar controls, a robust move set -- yet Krome seems content to settle for mediocrity when placing them into a cohesive whole.",
"SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE may not be the shooter that you expected, but can still entertain. Its less focus on story and more focus on Roguelike elements do hurt the overall experience though, preventing it from being as good as its predecessor.",
"Wuppo is a coin with two faces. On one side we have the simplicity of the plot and the rough design, on the other side we have an adventure with goals that can be found only with the right amount of observation and challenging bosses. Which side will you pick?",
"That's the huge problem with Nerf N-Strike Elite: the lack of content. All it has is a short story mode and the same shooting range for each gun. The co-op is fun, and the Nerf gun aesthetic is nifty, but there just isn't a lot to do.",
"Forza Horizon 5 is the culmination of all of Playground Games' efforts to perfect its craft, and the result is the best open-world racing game you can play. It combines the most beloved parts of Forza Horizon 3 and 4 into one ultimate racer.",
"So while this game might take you only a few days to beat, its presentation and feel make for a fun pinball game not like any other. If you’re looking for something that takes pinball to a new level of greatness, look somewhere else.",
"A very solid western turn-based strategy that doesn’t really fail at anything it’s trying to accomplish, even though the camera movements are capable of ruining a perfectly good fight and Native American culture should have been significantly more prominent.",
"A real no frills game for the PSP, but it offers a solid racing experience and is different to the majority of racing games available for the system. It's technically impressive and offers plenty of stats to track and bonuses to unlock, and multiplayer is there if you can find anyone to play with.",
"Summer Sports: Paradise Island is exactly what it sounds like, a mini-game collection full of exciting sports you mostly play when the sun is out and everybody is complaining about the heat.",
"Although the game is still fun, the updates in the remaster, when compared to the original, are just not enough. This is especially evident when looking at the controls, which have only been marginally optimized. It is also quite hard to keep an overview when there’s a lot going on and the original’s multiplayer mode is missing. If the developers are willing to upgrade the game via patches, we might be willing to give it a second chance.",
"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code+ is a neat approach at taking Danganronpa's core concept and taking it outside of the Battle Royal Death Game world. There are a lot of extremely strong concepts, and when they come together well, it's easy to see how this could've eclipsed even its ancestor. Unfortunately, things are a tad too muddled, too simple, and too divorced from one another to be a cohesive whole. If you're a fan of the Danganronpa titles, then it's worth a shot. Otherwise, I'd recommend starting with one of those before Rain Code.",
"There’s clearly been plenty of love and attention given to the remastering of Age of Empires Definitive Edition, even if some of the less enjoyable elements of the original have also made it through the process unscathed. Twenty years later it still remains a hugely enjoyable RTS, and particularly thanks to its iconic soundtrack remains a joy to play, with hours disappearing as the eras pass you by.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan and its brutal action combat will be a real challenge for you, and manages to deliver a very enjoyable gameplay experience. Although with some bumps in the road, it is a game that manages to earn his spot in the genre with a challenging proposal and with some very interesting ideas.",
"It isn't clear why this real-time game was created at all, when the world would be far happier with another BLiTZ system title. It makes it tough to recommend, even for a Chronicles aficionado, because the other things that went into making the earlier game so enjoyable – a jaunty alternative history/fantasy plot populated by an interesting bunch of characters – feel half-baked here. Everything, from gameplay to graphics to the storyline, is worse.",
"Purists will decry the changes made to Majora’s Mask no matter how slight they may be, but I am seated firmly in the “change is good” camp. It’s everything you remember, but without the boredom or frustration related to the passage of time.",
"To sum-up LEGO City Undercover to a simple GTA with bricks would be a shame. Full of satire fore previous Telltale LEGO games and rich without any franchise to support it, City Undercover is able to charm with extensive content, no violence, and several layers of subtext for all to enjoy. It's a trans-generational game, and a good one at that.",
"To wrap everything together for you, Metal Saga is definitely not your average RPG. The game features a cliché storyline, a nameless youngling as a main character, horrible graphics, an overused soundtrack and a nasty stream of currency.",
"Splatoon 3: Side Order is a refreshing yet familiar take on the Splatoon setup and well suited for short play sessions and runs to try and take on the lengthy tower. It's longevity, though, is very much grounded in whether rogue-like games and skill-trees appeal. As someone who didn't quite gel with the previous Splatoon single player modes, Splatoon 3: Side Order does tick a lot more boxes - mainly due to the compact, focused approach and that desire to keep pushing further.",
"Batman and Rocksteay have achieved the impossible again, offering an amazing and unforgettable story and, at the same time, adding unique gameplay touches thanks to the perfect integration of the Batmobile. And all that wrapped in one of the most stunning and impressive technical showcases of the new consoles. A truly enjoyable ride that no fan of Batman should miss.",
Monaco is a good game but with too many repetitive mechanics and without a real differentiation between the characters. The coop mode starts with a bang but eventually becomes a little bit boring.,
"The average graphics and sound weigh down Starship Troopers. The ability to fight swarms of enemies is entertaining at first, but it can be a problem at times. Losing because the enemies attacked faster than you can kill them or because you looked the wrong direction for a second and a half can be frustrating.",
"Too difficult for newbies, but lacking too many cards for old-hat masters, the game finds and neatly settles into a perfect niche among newer yet established fans who like working with what they're given and/or don't necessarily have the money to buy the game's infamously costly booster packs.",
"The beautiful vehicles made me feel good even with all that tumbling. They might seem to lack details both in textures and mashes, but after some driving you realize that is all compensated by their in-game behavior.",
"Crimsonland's antiquated, cookie-cutter gameplay doesn't break new ground at all, but beneath the copious amounts of blood saturating the screen, you'll find that there's still some fun to be had in this mindless mutant massacre fest.",
"Breathtaking in ambition and crafted with the skill of a studio that's been making music games for 15 years, Rock Band 3 is Harmonix's masterpiece – a towering achievement not just for the genre, but for the medium itself.",
"Madden 25 is the latest game in a series that appears to have either run out of ideas or simply has no interest in coming up with new ones. Small new additions do little to inspire excitement and a major overhaul feels desperately needed, and is the least that fans deserve.",
"The Thaumaturge is an ambitious isometric RPG with an interesting story, which the player can lead to ever-changing and unexpected situations with well-considered moral choices. The artistic direction is inspired and does justice to the historical setting represented. As for the salutors, we would have only liked to see more of them, which is an indication of the good quality and characterization of those present in the game. A somewhat repetitive combat system and the technical sector with too many uncertainties, unfortunately, partially slow down the enthusiasm, but all in all we would still like to say that The Thaumaturge is a recommended role-playing experience; if nothing else, to lovers of the genre who are always eager for narrative crossroads and well-written dialogues.",
"Burning Skies does a decent job in terms of experimentation, thanks to the ""hybrid"" controls, but the graphics are worse than expected and the single player campaign does nothing new for the series.",
"A huge improvement over the last two games. Of course, that isn't saying much. Actually, Regeneration is a lot of fun to play, but it's marred by a host of bugs and an ugly presentation.",
"Splatoon 2 is just about everything you could ask for from a sequel. It builds on everything the original set up and then some; almost every single major issue people had with the first game has been resolved, showing that Nintendo is genuinely listening and wants to deliver the absolute best experience possible. It maintains the freshness you’d expect and throws in countless big and small changes and additions, every one of them for the better. Anyone who says Nintendo can’t do online should be eating their words right now; Splatoon 2 is simply inkredible and continues Nintendo's trailblazing first year of Switch stunners.",
Kingdom Hearts fans - particularly those who can justify the game's astronomical price point of $60 for about five hours of new content - will definitely enjoy their brief time with Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue.,
"Metro: Last Light rarely feels like a revolutionary shooter experience, but it embraces the traditions of its genre and combines them with trail-blazing visuals and a gripping story.",
"It's silly to think that a team like USC, with so many returning stars, would have the same number of impact players as Cal. Instead of picking a lucky number and binding every team to it, the designers should have bound the number of impact players to some transitional stat, like returning upper-classmen.",
"Put simply, Samurai Warriors 4 Empires is the very best this series has to offer. Taking the refined core gameplay of Samurai Warriors 4 and dousing it in the tactics of Nobunaga’s Ambition has worked wonders.",
"Offers the best in arcade street racing with a large selection of cars, lively cast of characters, wonderful locations, challenging course designs, single, multiplayer, and online racing, and endless creative possibilities with the Race Editor.",
"I had quite high expectations for Commandos: Origins. I wasn't disappointed in the most important aspect - it's a good stealth game, in which quietly eliminating enemies is rewarded and even desired. However, I cannot turn a blind eye to its archaisms and poor technical aspects.",
"All of the multiplayer, both co-op and competitive, completely makes up for any that was lacking in the first game. For those that thought that Gears just wasn’t suited to multiplayer gameplay, that it was too tactical and slow and was better suited to a single player experience, prepare to eat your words. It’s fantastic, and rounds out the complete package that is Gears of War 2...Gears of War 2 is about as close as you can get to the perfect gaming package.",
"As a blend of intrigue, mystery, sci-fi, and horror – Close to the Sun may not be the turn of the century BioShock that pre-release media might have suggested, but there’s plenty of electricity and power to be found in the story it tells.",
"You don’t change a winning team, and that’s almost exactly what EA Sports FC 25 is offering this season. The basis of the precedent is there, with changes that are more like adjustments than profound upheavals. The fun is there, the life of the title always as consistent and finally there is enough new material in each mode to invite you to experience. The big plus is the Rush mode, clearly, and we’ll have to see how EA Sports plans to exploit a well-promoted mode everywhere in the coming months to gauge its potential accurately. In the meantime, deep in love or not in love with the ball, you know what to do in a few days with your money. One more season.",
"Samurai Warriors 4 Empires is a nice change of pace for those who want more to the Warriors franchise than just hack and slash. Not that the hacking and slashing isn't fun, but the addition of the strategy elements makes it and even better game and one that is a blast to play.",
Does an excellent job rekindling the fun and excitement found in previous MarioKart titles. The addition of some new gaming elements and awesome visual and audio presentations make this a quality title.,
"Part Time UFO is a delightful little gem that boasts plenty of charm and is sure to keep you smiling throughout. While I often find the claw machines in arcades to be a frustrating time, Part Time UFO is anything but and a strong recommendation if you’re after something easy to jump into alone or with a co-op partner in tow.",
"Great idea, poor execution. It's a common story, but this was supposed to be an uncommon game. Hopefully things will turn around should a sequel pan out, but the first Death's DOA.",
"While more than a few games leave me wondering what the developer could have done if they'd had more time and resources, SiN Episodes feels like a complete and polished experience that's been mulled over and considered for quite some time.",
"Melbits World is the cutest game that I've ever played. Not only that, it's also impressively challenging and a fantastic co-op experience for up to 4 players. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys local multiplayer with friends.",
"I have yet to play a game that needed a Definitive Edition as much as Xenoblade Chronicles, and it fully delivers. It’s a game no JRPG fan should miss, and a version that no JRPG fan should bypass for a second or third play-through.",
"A disappointment. With mediocre graphics and limited gameplay, it has an interesting yet a bit commonplace story, although in fact the game results are enjoyable despite its flaws.",
"It’s a little rough around the edges in terms of polish and fidelity, but as a fighting game, it’s charmingly ambitious. Generally speaking, it has a cool vibe with neat interpretations of classic characters from dark storytelling’s past.",
"EA Sports FC 25 is an exceptional soccer simulator, a more realistic and fun experience than in previous years, with welcome adjustments to the on-field action and enhancing the sport's tactical approach like never before. FC 25 is a must-have for fans of the British sport.",
"Urban Trial Playground does a few interesting things, but they’re overshadowed and ultimately held back by a number of factors. While I found the scored-based levels that relied on tricks to be more fun than the racing sections, gameplay is just not deep enough to be engaging for more than a short period of time. Couple that with the somewhat frequent software crashes and it’s easy to see how this ends up becoming a forgettable experience.",
"Madden 25 is an apt representation of the broader games industry. The push for greater realism and immersion leads to some impressive achievements, but it comes at the expense of everything else, including a sense of ambition. Meanwhile, you’ve got EA College Football 25 over here with goofy mascots, over-the-top spectacle, and a greater sense of fun, and it isn’t afraid to do things differently in the pursuit of making play more interesting. There’s only so much you can do to make football play and feel more realistic, and once you reach that goal, you need to start looking elsewhere to make things worthwhile. Madden feels like it’s at that point, and I think for the sake of polish as much as creativity, EA needs to take more than a year between releases to get Madden back on track.",
"Close to the Sun is a game that’s only remarkable for its scenery. And it’s a shame, really, as the Helios could have carried a great tale. As it is though, while there’s nothing about Close to the Sun that’s broken, there’s nothing compelling enough to make it worth your while, especially with its short run time and lack of replayability.",
"There is no denying that A Total War Saga: Troy is suffering from numerous problems, as the formula that started with Rome 2 and reached its full potential with Warhammer 2 is starting to show its age, and proves that it is time for major changes in the core mechanisms of the series. All that said, Troy is still an entertaining experience if you are a hardcore strategy fan and can keep you engaged for many, many hours.",
"Despite incongruous story points and sometimes clunky camera work, Silent Storm deserves the support of all right-thinking strategy fans. With its turn-based combat and destructible scenery it signals something fresh in the stale mound of World War Two games.",
"There are numerous interesting puzzles that unfold because of the game’s unusual mechanics and set up, and it would be almost unfair to ruin any of them for you here. We’d therefore recommend trying out A Space For The Unbound if you’re looking for something that’s clearly been made with love and passion – it’s hard not to be whisked away by its charms.",
"Dicefolk puts an interesting twist on classic ideas. Controlling both dice sets in combat creates cool challenges and gives players options to deal with powerful enemies. There’s also plenty of variety, powered by tokens and items, to create personalized strategies and find novel ways of engaging with bosses. While the chimera idea is interesting, the game failed to draw me into its universe. Dicefolk knows the genre it's working in and has the innovation required to draw in veterans looking for new ideas but it might struggle to keep them interesting in the long run.",
"SiN is actually something of a guilty pleasure. It's over far too quickly and feels rather unsophisticated, but I enjoyed it anyway, a bit like I enjoy...eating hotdog. [June 2006, p.62]",
"Lacks the sparkle of games such as Split/Second or Burnout. The destruction elements feel a bit weak, the cars control poorly at times and the computer AI is truly merciless. The biggest problem, though, is the lack of a proper tutorial in the game, a sure-fire way to alienate many players almost instantly.",
"Left 4 Dead minus the Zombies, plus a truckload of skittering aliens. Pure brilliance, and free to boot? Valve knows how to make their customers happy. Get to downloading it, stat!",
"Trek to Yomi is Flying Wild Hog’s best game. Unlike Shadow Warrior 3, the studio’s first title in 2022 that was a huge step backward, Trek to Yomi is aimed at a niche audience. It’s short, violent, and poetic. The one-hit kill Kensei mode that’s unlocked after finishing the game for the first time also adds more replay value for the game while creating the potential for attracting hardcore gamers and speedrunners. The game can be enjoyed by many, but a very small group of people will hold on to it for a very long time. That’s why Trek to Yomi has the chance to become a cult title.",
"Missions are equally dull - blow up this and collect that, nothing you haven't seen before. You can have a mate join the killing in co-op mode, but that's only fun for an hour. After that you'll have exhausted most of Raze's Hell's potential - apart from its potential as a makeshift frisbee. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]",
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is a brilliantly odd release. Newcomers to Kingdom Hearts may be put off by the complexity of the stories they’re thrown into, but Dream Drop Distance and A Fragmentary Passage are accessible enough via sheer gameplay alone. Really, it’s just puzzling why this title gets released first when Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix (a much more substantial and sensible package) is only a couple months away. In the meantime, this package makes for a promising start before Kingdom Hearts III.",
"With levels that build on each other in terms of complexity (and, thusly, difficulty), the game inspires that kind of ""just one more level"" feeling of addiction that may result in you freeing Dan from his insomnia but earning yourself a nasty case in return.",
"Left 4 Dead top down! Alien Swarm is fast-paced, alien-filled fun that demands cooperative gaming and delivers cleverly directed missions that stay challenging from beginning to the end. The upgrade systems serves as a motivator and the match making is quite good. Physics, sound and lighting convey a spooky atmosphere. Although there is only one campaign at release, Alien Swarm delivers more fun than most full-price games.",
"Target Liberty is a game so clunky, dated and downright unlovable that between its miserable graphics, woeful presentation and tedious gameplay it feels more like a late-90s budget PC release than a premium PSP game with a price-tag to match, and playing it is as pointless and unrewarding an enterprise as you're likely to get for £30.",
It’s undeniable though that if you’re after some solid strategy action to exercise both the brain and the thumbs that Samurai Warriors 4: Empires will satiate your desires; just don’t expect it to blow you away.,
"Insecticide melds sloppy platforming/shooter action with lightweight adventure puzzling, cemented together by a derivative pseudo-film-noir plot chock-full of atrocious puns. Swat this one away.",
"If you liked the humor and structure of the Sam & Max episodes, then you’ll probably enjoy the Strong Bad episodes as well. The Strong Bad episode is also a much better “animated feature” than what just came out in theaters last week, and for about the same price.",
"Old Gods Rising takes a great premise, but unfortunately does very little with it. The barren, but confusing campus leads to pointless wandering that does little to reward exploration and the narrative is delivered through generic exposition. The one successful aspect is the sense of uncertainty and unease that permeates the experience, yet this isn’t enough to maintain interest. The Old Gods may have been better off staying put.",
"This is a cautionary tale: nowhere in Unbounded does it tell you that you have to hold down the drift button the whole way through a corner, going against instincts built up by every other arcade racer ever, in order to have fun. When you do hold it down, though, Ridge Racer Unbounded is brilliant.",
"Dark Sector is engaging and addictive, but only the first time through. After beating the game, you will more than likely find yourself searching for a reason to work through the storyline again.",
"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions delivers a good Spider-Man experience for the current generation of consoles. The combat is done well, even in the first-person battles, and the feeling of being Spider-Man translates well, despite the lack of an open-world setting.",
"There is a lot of thought that has been put into this game's survival modes, and people will enjoy that side of things. It's just a shame that thought couldn't be put into the rest of the game.",
"Story Mode – Episode 2 ups the action and engages with its characters, making for a short but enjoyable hour; however, Telltale still struggles to give the player meaningful choices, balance tone, and create a unique story – though they’re well on their way.",
"SiN Episodes: Emergence has a number of shortcomings, but its weak storyline is the most noticeable. The success of the series as a whole is riding on this first episode, but other than being a fun shooter, it does nothing to hook the player.",
"The series has always been strong, but never as good as it is this year. In fact it's all but perfect, needing only a few tweaks, a few polishing strokes, and Microsoft's promised Xbox Live! service to make it ideal.",
"I literally fell asleep 15 minutes into my first ""exciting"" mission of taking pictures of fish, so that should tell you something. But stick with it, and you may find yourself inexplicably drawn in. [Mar 2003, p.116]",
Dead Island: Riptide is more of the same. In the case of combat and leveling up this is a good thing. But unfortunately it also bring along all of the issues of its predecessor. They've also chosen for the more linear jungle and city settings instead of the unique holiday resort. These faults make this a disappointment that can still be fun to play.,
"There are just a few things wrong with this game, like repetitive land battles, horrible AI and no save options that lead me to the conclusions that no one should get this game. There are plenty of great pirate games out there, if you want a good one look elsewhere.",
"Trek to Yomi is a brief but captivating journey that’s like playing through a monochromatic Japanese movie, and that excellent presentation is enough to carry it even though it falls short in most other respects. Combat is one-note and easily mastered, and exploration and puzzles don’t have much to offer aside from a fleeting distraction. Thankfully, its relatively brief story was one that still drew me in enough to absolutely feel worth my time.",
"Even if you think the double dipping of Ultimate was a scam, it is hard to deny the value of being able to play this amazing brawler whenever, and wherever, you want. I cannot recommend this game enough and if you own a Vita, this is easily a must-own in my book.",
"Commandos: Origins offers gameplay that hits the mark for real-time tactics fans, but everything surrounding it feels like it’s stuck in the past. The visuals and audio are functional at best, with little flair, and the story is exactly what you'd expect—and nothing more. With its $49.99 price tag, it's hard not to feel like you're paying a bit too much for something this straightforward.",
"The game looks great, sounds great, has great writing, offers a lengthy and satisfying journey, has a great technical element and engaging sword-swinging and spell-slinging. It would be difficult to find a game out there with better production values, or that meets its goals so successfully while still introducing new ideas and innovations.",
"The way that the dialog sequences are just text -- not even a face of who's talking to go with the text -- and how the bosses don't even get their own theme song for battles, there are just too many compromises made in the production value to maintain the energy and excitement that this game needs.",
"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the ultimate FF experience that improves the series in almost any direction and offers more than 100 hours of adventure, proclaiming the acclaimed series as the king of the JRPG genre and itself as one of the best releases of the current video game generation.",
Anyone looking for the next great western-themed game will no doubt adore Call of Juarez. The switch between characters adds depth and variety and the addition of multi-player gives the game legs outside of finishing the single-player adventure.,
"A fun and quirky RPG that infuses the leveling system with some BDSM flair. It is great for an hour here or there when wanting to relax, and the avant-garde approach to leveling has to be praised. Those who have problems with sexuality will have issues with the game.",
"The best Lego videogame ever made. This game isn't only a big evolution of the Traveller's Tales gameplay formula, it's also a great sandbox experience with more than 20 hours of gameplay. A must-have for Wii U owners.",
"While the omission of co-op play in this outing is an unexpected disappointment, Lego City Undercover is the best game in the series so far. It's consistently fun and surprising, offering the freedom of a great open-world game without all the guilt.",
"Super Princess Peach is not a truly remarkable title on the scale of Mario & Luigi, not only as it's not very funny, but its innovations in interface and design actually make it slightly less fun than it might be if you played it 'straight'.",
"A particularly repetitive gameplay that fails to innovate and remains very similar to that of the first chapter will be appreciated by fans of the historical series, but it will definitely be frowned upon by those who have not particularly loved the first Crusader.",
"It's exactly that solid game you're looking for to take with you on a long trip, or to play when you've gotten tired of all sports games and the like. Konami was smart for picking this up for publishing.",
"Bar none, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is my favourite arcade game on the Switch so far. The game’s short burst levels, no matter how challenging or luck-based they may be, lend themselves so well on a portable console. Rya Ga Gotoku Studios have done incredibly well in recreating and returning the niche love their arcade series has brought over the years. With plenty of playtime, cute characters to play around with, minigames to battle your friends in and challenging missions to overcome, Banana Mania can be everything you’ve ever needed in an arcade game on the Switch. It’s worth going ape over, folks.",
"Mind Control Delete reforms Superhot’s signature slow motion power fantasy into the shape of a procedurally generated roguelike. It retains the shiny spartan aesthetic, the bellicose narrative, and the most satisfying first-person shooter gimmick of the last decade, but the twists and tweaks behind its operation don’t alter its basic complexion. Superhot felt euphoric when it was new. Mind Control Delete can only reheat that sensation of extravagance.",
"Tropico 3 definitely shines out as a polished, well designed example of management simulation. While the campaign itself is a little short, the real appeal is in establishing your own personal benchmarks, beating other players’ scores online and earning in-game accolades through achievements.",
Cities XL 2012 is just more of the same: if you enjoyed playing the previous game you will probably consider buying the new add-on at a discounted price. But if you never fell in love with this game you won't do so now.,
"Only $10 for three arcade titles that have written the Mortal Kombat history might seem like a bargain, but the big issues with the online mode and sounds does not justify the purchase. At least until a substantial patch to fix them will not be released.",
While it isn’t a perfect game it does manage to come rather close to that mark. If you have a PC that is able to run Tropico there is no reason not to run out and buy the game. It is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.,
"Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 is just like the console version, but thanks to the stunning screen of Vita it is also more beautiful. The touch functions definitely work but could make the complex combat system too easy and unbalanced.",
"I went into Forza Horizon 5 expecting a pretty racing game. What I got was an experience, a splendid open-world car exploration simulator with light RPG elements and a trunk full of things to do and see. While I’d like to see Playground try something new or perhaps break free from the existing formula next time, this is a clear candidate for 2021’s best game and a must-play, whether you have Game Pass or not.",
"Taken as a whole, Trek to Yomi is an impressive homage to classic Japanese action films. It looks and sounds incredible, with art direction and music that are impeccably authentic to both history and cinema. As an action game, Trek to Yomi is engaging but a bit lacking in variety and depth, with controls and animations less polished than its visuals. Trek to Yomi is a fascinating and altogether unique experience, worth playing if you're a fan of great samurai films or simply enjoy new variations on the action game formula.",
"Luckily, the plethora of new additions makes the nagging issues less offensive. It just misses being the football messiah many Maddenites are claiming it to be, but Tiburon has found a way to take their successful formula to the next level, creating a football experience that’s not only incredibly satisfying now, but has me looking forward to where they go from here.",
"NBA 2K23 has something for everyone to get stuck into – whether you want to get engrossed in the Jordan era or have your own come up in MyCareer, all provide a lot to work with. With some of the best visuals to hit consoles and deep gameplay that plays so solidly, NBA 2K23 is a great iteration of the franchise.",
"While there is definitely room for improvement, Jupiter Hell is one of those Early Access projects that really used its time well. Two years of development make this finished product feel like a polished and definitive roguelike experience. Imminently approachable and nostalgically fulfilling, Jupiter Hell slays all expectations and provides a potent combination of action and strategy that shouldn't be missed. Everyone from veteran rogues to boomer shooter diehards will find something to appreciate in these bloodstained halls.",
"Overall, Once Human’s blend of action, survival/crafting, and MMORPG-like mission design kept me entertained and happily occupied. While some of the more challenging enemies are designed around multiplayer teamwork, the majority of the game’s content is solo player-friendly. Once Human can be approached and enjoyed in lots of ways. It needs some further refinement, but Once Human’s hybrid genre approach pays off.",
"A big part of what made the PC version be so great was the whole atmosphere; you felt like you were in Chicago in the 1930s. Unfortunately, the visual inedibility of the Xbox version takes a good chunk of this feeling.",
"Sure, there's still plenty of room to cram more into the game (I'd love to see some kind of proper multiplayer support), but as it stands, this expansion pack is definitely worth the purchase.",
"Despite a few minor hiccups, Yonder offers a beautiful world to explore at your pace. You won't be fighting legions of demons to save the island, but you do collect cats and the likes.",
"If you’ve been waiting for a great Western-themed shooter, then look no further than Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood. The gameplay is fun and varied, the story is entertaining, the visuals are well done, the voice acting is terrific, and the game even sports a respectable online offering.",
"A very solid role playing game, capable of even winning in some aspects to major videogames from this genre like The Witcher or Neverwinter Nights 2. The worst problem, though, it's a subpar storyline.",
"Achievement hunters and completionists may find Trek to Yomi more daunting with its multiple playthrough requirements and the cursed decision to forego a chapter select feature. The majority of the game's challenges come from completing boss encounters without taking any damage, and failing to do so means rerunning the entire campaign or manipulating cloud saves to try again, which simply feels like forced padding of otherwise solid gameplay.",
"From storytelling to game design, Those Who Remain's tepid approach to its overabundant tropes made me want to leave Dormont as soon as I arrived. My best advice to horror fans: ignore the exit—even if your tank is running low.",
"With Squids Odyssey, Nintendo earns a sort of Angry Birds with a RPG taste, adding an arrow to the bow of its eShop. While the game is not perfect. you won't find anything similar on the other next gen consoles.",
"It’s not perfect. There are moments of irritation, mostly during those Batmobile sequences. But when it’s firing on all cylinders – which is the bulk of the time – there’s just no other super hero game like it.",
It wasn't that good a game when it was first released as a PS Vita exclusive and it didn't get any better now. Liberation is one of the worst moments in the Assassin's franchise that only manages to send you running back to Black Flag.,
"The mix of ideas at play in Darksiders 2 could have turned out to be a disaster, but Vigil stitches it all together expertly. From the corrupted idyll of The Forge Lands, to the twilit expanses of The Land of the Dead, to the thin, broken line between Heaven and Hell, Death's grand adventure ranks among the best we've seen or will see in 2012.",
"Blade Kitten is a controversial platform / action game, with some strenghts (Kit can do almost everything, from climbing the walls to fight with a flying sword) and some flaws (the level design is mediocre, the combat system is simplistic and there are some minor bugs). With its nineteen levels, the game will entertain you for a few hours.",
"Diablo II: Resurrected delivers on the promise of a rebuilt original, without tampering with the soul of what made it amazing in the first place. With completely remastered graphics, all-new cutscenes, and console cross-progression, Diablo II: Resurrected takes us back to Hell, and it’s every bit as amazing as it was when we played it 20 years ago.",
"Tropico goes back to its roots with a new developer which has reproduced the most noticeable and fun elements of the first Tropico, merging the typical city management options with politics and social planning, which makes this a very interesting and engaging game.",
"The Last Story's preferred focus on combat and characters puts it far enough apart from Xenoblade, with its focus on exploration and the wider world that there's more than enough space for both games to carve out their own identities and stand proudly together.",
"The cash cow of Ultimate Team will always override everything else with FC 25, sadly. In an ideal world, EA Sports would develop Clubs into a major eSport, which would do extremely well. Real world soccer clubs around the world could have their own teams, and most importantly, the gameplay would then take priority with Ultimate Team being in the background generating income. Plainly, the game would be much better for it.",
"Fans of the franchise probably won't be too disappointed if they pick this up, but people looking for a series point-and-click adventure game are probably going to want to go elsewhere.",
"Granted, the chase sequences are frustrating and the story falls a bit flat, but there's some wonderful attention to detail in Close to the Sun's environments, and tension is present even in the game's calmest moments.",
"Perhaps Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII's most lasting achievement will be once again proving that strategy games can work on consoles. And though it doesn't quite make the case for console strategy ever really being as good as PC-based efforts, the game is worth trying for anyone who can let their historical curiosity overcome their need for visual and interface flair.",
"The nostalgic flair from back in the early strategy days is still there. But sind RTS came such a long way and has improved even with its successor (in 1999) tremendously, the gameplay deficits are also more evident.",
"I suspect that most fans of the Soulslike genre will have a great time with The First Berserker: Khazan - especially if their primary focus is on the gameplay. It has some thoughtful approaches to easing frustration while maintaining that rewarding, Soulsian challenge. The First Berserker: Khazan may not be on the level of a Bloodborne or a Sekiro, but in the midst of combat, it can feel shockingly close.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is an interesting representative of the Soulslike genre, offering its own original ideas and a very strong plot. The game is able to break a person even on an easy difficulty level.",
"What was once an intricate, tactical action game has effectively been dumbed down to appeal to a wider audience, and the technical issues and inconsistent A.I. leave the fun relatively AWOL for the hardcore Ghost Recon vets.",
"I’m not totally sure as to who the target audience is for this collection. Older gamers who would have enjoyed these games in an arcade have had several other ways in which to play a lot of these games through the years. And that isn’t including games such as Pac-Man Championship Edition, which brings the classic gameplay up to date with modern gaming mechanics. Younger gamers, who may have never played any of these games, probably won’t enjoy most of them due to their money stealing design. I certainly would encourage youngsters to try out Pac-Man, Galaga and Dig Dug, as they are genuine classics, but $30 for two or three games that I would play long-term just doesn’t seem like good value. This game is probably best being held off on until a price drop.",
"A too heavy name for a brand new game with poor story, fragile gameplay mechanics (except for a local multiplayer) and a light appeal. The shoot 'em up market has definitely much more to offer.",
"Age of Empires Definitive Edition is stuck between past and present. On the one hand this is a beautiful remake with nostalgic gameplay, but the problems of the past still plague the game, making the Definitive Edition a shell of its former self.",
"If you've already played it there are not too many reasons to get it again. If not, you'll find a game with some errors that cannot hide its portable origins, but still enjoyable if you're looking for more Assassin's Creed.",
"On top of all of this, the gameplay is generally too simple for its own good. Judgment is an adequate if simplistic fighter, taking a step in the wrong direction for each original and unique thing it attempts to do. It doesn't even pay good homage to its source material.",
"Thought it seems simplistic at first, it doesn't take long to see the true depth of Loop Hero. Thanks to its very approachable design and killer gameplay hook, this is the kind of addicting and engrossing experience that can steal whole weeks from your life. Just don't say we didn't warn you!",
"Gears of War 2 delivers on every one of its promises, combining a rich and intimate story, brutal, visceral combat, incredible graphics, outstanding audio design, a strong soundtrack, and a robust multiplayer suite.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan is one of the toughest action games and soulslikes in recent years. It's relentlessly punishing, with challenging spectacle fights and bosses to overcome. However, each challenge you do topple leads a sense of satisfaction that harkens back to the genre’s origins when everyone was less experienced at these games. That combat is only let down by a somewhat overwhelming story for newcomers to the Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) universe, a lack of accessibility options besides an easy difficulty, and a gear crafting system that feels unnecessary.",
"At times Soldiers plays more like a 3rd person action RPG, but that’s not a bad thing. I originally felt that Soldiers does both RTS and action RPG at the same time, only neither one very well. That would be unfair as the nuances of this game reflect the uncompromising nature of Codemasters’ philosophy on gaming and the creative ingenuity of 1C.",
"There’s no doubting that The Silver Case 2425 is a stylish affair, with two unique and mature stories to sink your teeth into. It’s just a shame that it’s sometimes so dull, with unnecessary scenes that don’t really add anything to the story, and dialogue that is at times nonsensical and others impenetrable. If you have enough patience, you’ll likely find yourself eventually rewarded by The Silver Case 2425, but for many it won’t be worth the arduous slog. In any case, thanks to the portability of Switch, this is perhaps the best way to enjoy this duo of crime-fuelled visual novels.",
"While the action on the court is still fantastic and the new game modes are very entertaining and play with basketball fans' nostalgia, NBA 2K23 is brought down by its excessive microtransactions, which are the very definition of ""pay-to-win"".",
"The charm that covers nearly every inch of this game is also infectious, especially as this medium can better actualize its main characters’ imagination into something playable. Sometimes those playable aspects can get in the way but it’s still easy to saddle up on this bike even if that bike sometimes slams on the brakes.",
"Beneath old school pixelart coat lies surprisingly komplex game, which takes the loop factor to another level. It's simple, it's hard to beat, it's fun to play and maybe too addictive to try. But once you try Loop Hero, you'll be hook for a long time. [Issue#310]",
"Critter Café first hour exudes coziness as you begin collecting creatures and decorate your modest coffee house. But soon, it becomes painfully apparent that the developers did not flesh out their designs. The next eleven hours are filled with routine sokoban puzzles, playing four basic mini-games, and seeing the game’s eponymous animals not do much of anything. Do not squander your time with this one.",
"Puzzle Bobble is simply one of the most popular and played puzzle games in videogames history. In this new edition we find the usual gameplay but also many new modes including... Space Invaders. If you love the series, don't pass it up.",
"The more time I spend with The Thaumaturge, the more I settle into it. When you spend more time with any game you are bound to notice the edges of things, the literal and figurative invisible walls. But The Thaumaturge was more like a pair of shoes. As I learned the restrictions of what you couldn’t do in the game, it focused me towards things I could do, and they were all awesome. If you have been craving a dark fantasy RPG where you get to play as a John Constantine type, I have good news, The Thaumaturge is it. Anyone looking for their next interesting and original RPG, this is it!",
"While skill development is not required to enjoy Standalone Complex, the brainy customization options leave a lot of room for experimentation and, thus, lots of fun for those tired of the all-too simplistic action of ""Coded Arms.""",
"Just as Endless Legend and Civilization V are now far superior to how they started, so can Endless Space 2 be. It’s odd to talk of foundations in something so markedly floaty and space-based, so perhaps it’s better to think of this as an outpost, plonked down on a planet waiting to be colonised. It’s a fertile planet, sure, but one that’s yet to be fully exploited.",
"Wilson’s Heart is good, even very good at points. Expertly mixing its story, sound and visual aesthetics into a solid experience that’ll draw you in and keep you engrossed for hours. But there are some niggles with the constrained gameplay mechanics that hamper its ability to be a great title.",
"Darksiders 2 is a series of peaks and valleys, but you spend more time at the top than you do in the pits below. More importantly, you spend even more time climbing and descending, claiming treasures and delving into the most dangerous parts of the world.",
"If you forgo your expectations of what a Castlevania game should be--or are simply looking for a respectable 3-D fighting game--you should have a good time with Judgment. [Holiday 2008, p.77]",
"Sorry We’re Closed is a unique horror shooter that blends arcade action with tactical gameplay, using classic audiovisual techniques to build tension. Its challenging combat, multiple endings, and seamless puzzles make for a rewarding experience.",
"Forza's main success is in finding a blend between pleasing the notoriously fickle minority that likes its driving games consistently challenging and demandingly detailed, while introducing a set of user-friendly assists that will ensure that even those who are new to the racing genre will enjoy themselves.",
"Truth be told, the presentation is awful, but this replay value is built to last with the right audience. And hey, with an easy 1000 points in achievements to be had (I unlocked them all within a few sessions), it's at least worth a rental for those on the fence.",
"Each fire is unique and has several factors that must be considered before any action can take place. Emergency Fire Response lets you see if you have what it takes, and it's ex-fireman approved.",
"Stronghold Crusader 2 is a good strategy game, effective and addictive. Still, pity he did not further revolutionizes the series, and we would like a true modern graphics engine have been developed for the occasion.",
"Unfortunately, the game does end up feeling underwhelming due to the mysterious lack of style that made the PSP games so darn fun. We can't really put our finger on any one thing, but it's probably the general feeling that the game just doesn't deliver the same level of entertainment.",
"In some ways, Yonder reminds of Animal Crossing with a bit of Fantasy Life thrown in, if one squints and tilts their head sideways. All three offer pleasant busywork and pastel colors, and they’re all just the sort of thing if a person’s in the mood for it. However, I strongly suspect that the optimal audience is comprised of kids looking for a game that offers a lot of easily-accomplished Stuff To Do without fear of restarts or penalties. Yonder: The Cloud catcher Chronicles isn’t a great fit for me and I suspect most seasoned players will bow out in a hurry, but I’m going to let my eight-year-old son sit down with it tomorrow, and I imagine I’ll have to pry him off of it with a crowbar.",
"With a sequel already released on the portable console with a bevy of new features, it's a shame that Lumines Plus couldn't have lived up to its name and actually included something new beyond an additional skin or two.",
"Elsweyr is a great way to start if you haven’t played TESO yet, but it’s also a great expansion for veterans. Tons of content and relevant additions make TESO one of the best MMO available at the moment.",
"What the game lacks in AI, balance, and vehicle control it more than makes up for with sheer originality, realistic fire, complex missions, and a level of authenticity only achieved through the collaboration with an international fire consultant.",
"Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers is game made for the fans. With around fifty characters to play as, three full story modes to experience and a netcode worthy of the modern age, it’s a title I feel hardcore fans of the series can enjoy.",
"EA Sports FC 25 looks, feels, and plays like a truly upgraded version of the franchise. It isn’t a perfect sports simulator, but it does a great job of making the game feel alive and takes another step forward for the franchise.",
"Hopefully in time, more maps and modes will give Concord a discernable, standout place in the crowded FPS market. Right now it’s a decent more-of-the-same option and a missed opportunity for Sony.",
"The best Codemasters F1 game so far. The F1 Classics section adds a little touch of magic and emotions to the package, while the core games delivers a great reproduction - if not simulation - of the F1 racing experience.",
"The latest entry in the Sword of the Stars series is a flawed dungeon-crawler, with uninspiring 16 bit style graphics and questionable game-design choices. Kerberos' challenge is not fair, even for the die hard fans of the genre: if you want to have some fun, play FTL: Faster Than Light instead.",
"Miyagi is annoying and the AR thing only impresses for a few hours, though Reality Fighters' surprisingly in-depth combat system and impressive array of fight styles and characters may win you over.",
"Hard West 2 is a tactically challenging work of art with a beautifully depicted environment and unique features that, much like its name, become progressively harder as you advance. Hardcore fans of tactical RPGs will savor what it has in store with its distinct combat system and necessity for well-thought-out strategies. Still, on the other hand, casual players may not be too happy with the level of difficulty as the game punishes aggressive and lackadaisical gameplay.",
"Mortal Kombat: Arcade Kollection is unfortunately a painful reminder of what could've been a full HD remake. That being said, without any major overhauls to the game's mechanics, it still wouldn't have played as well as it did in the past.",
"I would never go so far as to say that This is the Police 2 is a poorly or incompetently made game, but it is by no means a fun one. Even if you loved the first game, I cannot recommend this sequel to you, either for its gameplay or its story. For what it's worth, the game's story ends on a cliff hanger, and I am still interested in seeing how the next game turns out. I don't know if the third game will end up being a good one, but I do know that I have no desire to ever go back and play through the second one.",
"While the slower pace might cause some of the more hardcore fans of the series to take issue, it allows those not completely at home with the control scheme to finally be able to pull off some technically impressive plays, making it one of the most accessible Maddens yet.",
"Due to excellent voice performances, a mysterious, sleepy little town that has plenty of intrigue and secrets, the added benefit of some exploration, and the undeniably appealing rewind feature, the game has a unique and extremely absorbing feel.",
"Metronomicon has a lot going for it — the songs are catchy, the combat is intuitive, and the storyline, while thin, is delightfully weird. I only wish the developers had found a way to let me enjoy the graphics. As it stands, it’s a game that plays well and is interesting to watch, but doesn’t manage to be both of those things at the same time.",
"They say time heals all wounds, but free DLC can't hurt either. Dead Kings offers much for those still enamoured by the series, and its offering as a freebie is a fine gesture to anyone left aggrieved by last year's failings.",
"Madden NFL 25 sticks to the tried-and-true formula that fans know well. While the football action remains solid, the lack of innovation might leave long-time players craving something new. It’s a dependable entry in the series, but it doesn’t bring anything groundbreaking to the table.",
"The story is really good, the whole atmosphere of the game is beautiful, and fluid traversal is a joy to use. South of Midnight is a game you need to play - if only so you can experience the rollercoaster it is.",
"Sorry We're Closed could be described as the Signalis of 2024, offering a standout indie survival horror experience. With a unique take on love stories and well-crafted visuals reminiscent of the first PlayStation era, it draws inspiration from games like Killer7, Silent Hill, and Shadows of the Damned. The result is a memorable, atmospheric game that stands out with its own distinctive personality.",
"We struggle to recall a dystopia quite as cheerful as the one found in Pikuniku. It’s a short game, but one packed with heart and imagination, with a great single-player component and excellent couch co-op that can genuinely be enjoyed by anyone. It makes us remember the fun we had cutting pieces from our friends in Snipperclips, but where we occasionally hit a brick wall with that game, Pikuniku sidesteps frustration in favour of a breezy and charming adventure; a perfect salve if you need a break from the backlog, but don’t dive in expecting endless hours of gameplay.",
"Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is an outstanding example of mobile-to-Switch done right. A gorgeous looking, content-heavy slice of space shooting action with a deep plot, set in a lore filled universe that has taken years to mature during a decade since the Galaxy on Fire series premiered in the mobile market. True that just like the games of old within this genre, this remains niche and will possibly only tickle the fancy of a very specific target audience with the whole Switch owner population.",
"Blade Kitten saves itself from the lower reaches of the ten-point scale with some genuinely impressive level design. It's complex without being confusing, the tangled and involved areas seemingly offering multiple avenues but always pushing you along the correct route. [Issue#101, p.127]",
"Mini Motorways is a game that I can just vibe with. There was a period of time when I’d boot Mini Metro every single day in order to undertake the daily challenge. I can see that being the case again here. There’s an intricate, impossible-feeling balance to this game; it is fiendishly difficult and filled with tactical nuance with even things like the angle of how roads join one another impacting traffic speed - and yet it is also joyously mellow and inviting, the perfect way to whittle away some spare minutes. I can barely say a bad word about it.",
"Vigil nailed the Zelda formula in Darksiders 1. In attempting to evolve that in this sequel, the team stumbles a bit. It's like they wanted to keep Darksiders 2 mechanically consistent without drawing such overt references to their source material. Some story and technical blemishes crop up from this process but they don't distract from the great dungeon design and combat. Darksiders 2 is a great game, with still considerable room for improvement.",
"The graphics look excellent, sound effects and custom soundtracks are superb, the gameplay itself is rock-solid, damage modeling is present and accounted for, car customization goes even deeper than any game before it, the menu system is a god-send, and it's always ready to rock out on Xbox Live.",
"Neon White is a brilliant, immensely satisfying and stylish hybrid of an FPS and a platformer. It’s gameplay is crazy fast, the level design is stellar, and although the game takes place in Heaven, it’s devilishly addictive. It’s one of the best games of 2022, no doubt in my mind about it.",
"The Settlers: New Allies is a frustrating experience that lacks much of the series' fundamentals. This is a streamlined The Settlers game that has been simplified as much as possible, but if the goal was to create a big multiplayer hit by making it easier to get into, it misses the mark.",
"The gameplay is a castrated version of ""Warcraft III"" - you can see the hallmarks of a fine specimen, but the testosterone is all long gone - while the script is cringeworthy in places, reminiscent of the very worst desperate ""Lord of the Rings"" wannabes in fantasy fiction writing.",
"The First Berserker: Khazan may be the best non-FromSoftware soulslike yet. Its anime-inspired visuals, soaring orchestration, and frenetic combat make for an unforgettable experience. With a brutal, personal story and rich world-building, every battle carries weight. The skill floor and price may be steep for newbies, but greatness comes at a cost—and this one’s worth every blood drop and penny.",
"Classic on-rails shooter that sticks to its roots and does it well. The fact that Time Crisis 4 and Deadstorm Pirates are included on the disc certainly doesn't hurt. Razing Storm has a Story Mode in which the game tries its hand at being a full-fledged FPS (meaning you control where you go), but fails abysmally. That doesn't detract from the on-rails games, and if you're looking for a classic arcade shooter, this is a very neat package.",
"If you're looking to fall in love with a platformer that wears its heart on its sleeve, you'll be happy to know that these titles still do hold up tremendously well, even if they may not feel as polished as some newer games in the genre. If you're willing to deal with some frustrations from dated design, you may find yourself head over heels for this loveable Dream Warrior, no questions asked.",
"A better game than the original, but only slightly. With new abilities for old classes, attempts at new classes, and a few new features such as improved online play and ‘side-quests’, this emerges as the spiritual descendent of ""Diablo II.""",
"Guardian Heroes has a ton of gameplay options. You can choose to fight alone, or alongside a few friends in several game modes, which is a great new feature to this remake of the 1996 beat 'em up. It's unfortunate however that Guardian Heroes is one of the most chaotic games we've ever played, since it's often difficult to find your own warrior, when he is surrounded by big groups of enemies.",
"It's not perfect, but it's chockfilled with entertaining gameplay modes. If FIFA 06 is fine cuisine, FIFA Street 2 is a corndog and a coke and sometimes, there ain't nothing better than that.",
"Creating a superpower from Haiti isn’t an easy task but it sure was a fun run, I recommend SuperPower2 to people that like world simulations or to people that wish they could run any country on earth in anyway they see fit.",
"Endless Space 2 is the quintessence of the 4X genre. Despite confusing menus, some bugs and some issues with its combat system, it offers a deep and complex gameplay, and a captivating experience.",
"Side order is a surprising expansion pass with addictive and challenging content thanks to a complex roguelike-style system. Everything is balanced and its replayability is guaranteed, being able to spend many hours to unlock all its objects. Highly recommended.",
"Although somewhat far fetched, Coast Guard’s storyline can be rather captivating and adds a refreshing layer to the game. However, it gives the impression that it doesn’t really know what it wants to be, without the depth to a full ship simluator and with some lacking gameplay during the investigations.",
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is packed with well-crafted content, and unlike its predecessor, none of it feels like filler. While Cloud’s new and unknown journey isn’t finished just yet, Rebirth already delivers an emotional story that could have only been achieved with a remake. While a small amount of the minigames can be tedious, from exploration to battle, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a top-notch experience. It delivers a surprising amount of quality, quantity and diversity in its content, to the extent that there pretty much isn’t anything like it.",
"Immortals Fenyx Rising - Myths of the Eastern Realm’s lack of ambition and inability to distinguish itself from the base game’s adventure is a bit of a letdown, really. Attractive as the Chinese-themed reskin may be, just underneath is combat, exploration, and puzzle solving that is functionally nearly identical to what we’ve already played, and the characters aren’t nearly as much fun. After spending eight or so hours completing the story I have little compulsion to come back and check off all the things I didn’t get to on the map – after all, that stuff wasn’t particularly compelling in Immortals Fenyx Rising, and given that Myths of the Eastern Realm does precious little to change things up, it’s not particularly compelling here either.",
"Every change to the Myst formula, from the tablets to the varied control schemes, make End of Ages one of the best entries in the series. And the visuals and sound rank among the series' best as well. Highly recommended to Myst fans and plain adventure fans alike.",
"It's a shame that such a much-loved series has come to this, but here we are. So to conclude, SingStar Ultimate Party gets one point for nice menu screens and one point for Carly Rae Jepsen.",
"The freedom and range of item management creates huge scope for personalised gameplay and strategy, and while the dawdling pace won't suit many, those able to respect the game's qualities should find the experience very rewarding.",
"Thanks to its strong narrative, solid gameplay and overall richness of contents, Might & Magic: Heroes VI proves to be an absolute must buy for any fan of the series. If you're not among them, you might want to take a look at it anyway.",
A solid city builder in the spirit of classics like Caesar and Pharaoh. The complex economic system is challenging but also can get frustrating towards the end. The lack of a sandbox mode is most unfortunate.,
"RPG Maker FES has a lot of potential, but it's bound to be (at least partially) wasted. There's no tutorial, and it's impossible to edit the predefined (and limited) assets; the UI is simple and accessible to everyone, but the PC version is much more complete.",
"If the idea of pop music was a game, it'd be Just Dance 2014. Ubisoft has made sure that the game is bright, shiny, and fun. Shake your way through today's hits and a couple of classics, but the experience will be so much better with friends and family.",
"An insanely well-made kart game with tight controls, great tracks, and some sweet multiplayer action...quite possibly GameCube's best game this holiday season. [Grade = A+; Dec 2003, p.72]",
"This title is well done, and though it could have been better with a few tweaks here and there, for those who want a strategic game that is mostly non-linear in terms of accomplishing goals and requires you to think through movement phases, then Silent Storm may be what you are looking for.",
"Concord may not be worth $40 to some, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t $40 worth of game here. With PlayStation levels of production value, and exceptional gameplay, fans of hero or team-based shooters should find Concord appealing – if they give it a chance.",
"Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth knocks it out of the park. It takes the already excellent first game and expands it to a bigger and more populated world. The combat has been improved, the dungeon design is better, the story hits a lot more than it misses, and from start to finish, it was pretty much everything I could've wanted. Only a few nagging problems keep it from perfection, and it's a love letter to everything that makes Final Fantasy VII great.",
"It's hard to invest in lore that's so inextricably tied to the grind of missions or side-quests, hard to suspend your awareness of that grind when you're awash in constant pitches for boosters and special unlocks.",
"There’s a lot of repetition for battles, and lengthy sequences of cutscenes can certainly slow things down, but Revolution tells an engaging story with characters that grow on you over the hours of gameplay. Similarly, the combat system and customization grow, providing a much more engaging action experience in the latter half of the game.",
"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an ambitious title and Platinum Games delivers! The resulting game is pure hack & slash, filled with interesting features like the Blade mode and the Jack the Ripper mode, that manage to make the game feel fresh and, at times, even unique. It's a joy from beginning to end and even though Revengeance isn't a long game by any stretch of the word, you won't regret spending any of your hard-earned money on it.",
Deep statistics are offset by a clunky interface. A deep career mode is offset by annoying seasonal goals. Hi-res graphics are offset by frame rate issues. Great musics and stadium songs are offset by flimsy on-field sound effects.,
"It does an excellent job of expanding RCT3 - not only are there the nine new scenarios, but you can also use many of the new features in the existing scenarios, which is a nice touch.",
"Outstanding depth and tactical challenge have been preserved, although not at the expense of the strong storytelling needed to emphasize the sense of awe and wonder in galactic exploration that’s always been a huge part of the genre’s appeal. Amplitude has done a masterful job combining these two elements into a single game, where the quests and strategy and politics and economy are all tied into a whole much greater than the sum of its parts.",
"The glaive is something that every action nut has to wrap his or her hands around. Like the BFG or the cerebral bore, you’ll remember this weapon forever. Sadly, you’ll remember the weapon more than the game itself.",
"In one of the interviews, the developers stated that they wanted to start different project originally, but later decided to do This Is the Police 2 instead. Well, the sequel is not slopwork in any way, but you can’t help but feel a certain lack of enthusiasm and concentration of the game’s creators.",
"As he writes his own escape from the Dark Place, the tale ironically lacks the narrative punch of his first trek into the shadows. Even so, it invites us back into Alan's world, takes us on a new adventure and sheds new light on his predicament. The writer is correct: we love our characters, and if you love Alan Wake, you really don't have a choice. You must survive his American Nightmare.",
"The problem is it's a one trick pony. The shock of the violence and the speed of the gameplay initially grabs your attention, but it lacks the spectacle to keep itself feeling fresh and inventive, then before long a sense of banal repetition sets in. And you're not even a third of the way through the game. I can't deny that it gives you quite a lot of game for your money, but it also outstays its welcome.",
"Concord is not a horrible game or an industrial accident, but it is not up to other competitors. Even more after eight years of development. If the SF universe and the mood The Guardians of the Galaxy are interesting at first, it would have been better exploited with a solo mode annex for example. Although the variety of heroes and their skills is one of the qualities of the title, we regret the relative softness of the set, the lack of sensations of some powers and originality in the modes. In the end, after a few hours, and except for this test, we have trouble thinking that we will play it again.",
"We love the online play, Superstar moves and homage to Sega games like Sonic, The House of the Dead, Samba de Amigo and Jet Set Radio. It's fan service all the way. But the lack of a World Tour mode and ease of difficulty cripples the game's long-term appeal.",
"As long as you don’t mind that the game doesn’t really have a campaign and instead relies on skirmishes, then it can provide you with a worthwhile gaming experience. I’d just recommend that you wait for the price to drop down to well under the $50 mark where it is now.",
"So, take some of the best ideas from Mario and Kirby and throw in a lot of fun item collection and fantastic attention to detail and you have Super Princess Peach. [Apr 2006, p.73]",
"In conclusion, play Forza Horizon 5. There has never been a better looking game, and it plays like an absolute dream. It’s full of cars, full of challenge, full of glorious visuals and played out across a world like no other.",
"If you played the game on PS3 or Xbox 360, we can hardly advise you to open your wallet for Saints Row 4 : Re-Elected + Gat Out of Hell. Even with the large amount of content the game brings, 50 euros is still too much to ask for a GOTY edition without any visual improvements.",
"Those Who Remain is way to shaky to bring the players in a world of horror, or even have the slightest feel of fear. If you seek thrills, you can find much better elsewhere, and probably for cheaper.",
"Some ideas, such as the skill advancement and cover system, are underdeveloped while others, like the targeting system and overall mission design, are poorly executed. In the end, Target Liberty is more frustrating than engaging, more tedious than fun. That’s never a good thing.",
"Boxboy! is confident, assured programming. It’s brave to make a puzzle game in which players control a box with two little slits for eyes. It requires the confidence of the entire development team that they’re going to be able to imbue character into the experience despite the minimalism, and that the level design and puzzles would be interesting enough in their own right to maintain the player’s interest.",
"The Thaumaturge is a breath of fresh air in the world of RPGs: its universe is quite new, and steeped in a culture we're not used to see in video games. Its imperfections are masked by its originality and effective art direction.",
The Definitive Edition captures the romanticized memory that we had of this 20 year old classic and puts it in a modern game. The reworked graphics are marvelous and despite some badly aged mechanics like the path finding it is still fun to build your own ancient empire.,
"With its unique setting and interesting story mechanics powered by time-traveling, great sense of scale, and nice visuals, The Waylanders had the potential to be a remarkable role-playing game. The uneven pacing of the story, writing with wild quality shifts, the rather run-of-the-mill combat, the clunky interface, and a general lack of polish, however, make the game often frustrating to play, preventing it from reaching the heights it could have achieved.",
"Close to the sun, as its name, was to close to become an interesting game with Bioshock reminiscences. But its lack of variety and a repetitive gameplay makes the game a heavy piece of interesting things which never came for a correct development. An interesting world who stays at the surface of something who could be interesting to explore a little bit more.",
"The dual screens provide a perfect medium for the genre, and the inclusion of the rumble pack, which is compatible with the likes of Mario & Luigi at the moment and should feature in future releases, is a neat and thoughtful inclusion.",
"The gameplay is bad, the ""adventuring"" is boring, the magnificent Dune story is condensed into something dull and lifeless, but it looks pretty enough, if only when showing the massive and frightening giant worms.",
"Thanks to the introduction of FC IQ, the on-pitch action in EA Sports FC 25 is more dynamic and authentic than ever before. And while most other changes are small, the replacement of Volta with Rush, a 5v5 match type that is accessible in most game modes, makes this a worthy upgrade from last year's release overall.",
"A good platforming experience that is only somewhat overshadowed by its limited gamespan. However, it&#146;s a solid return to next gen consoles for Pitfall Harry, and the inclusion of the original Pitfall and Pitfall II games makes this a must have for action fans.",
"It is glorious. Maybe not perfect, but still very good. It has everything I loved from Banana Blitz HD, and little of what I didn't. I highly recommend checking it out if you're new to the series, or if you just want to see a Dreamcast in a ball. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 71]",
"Despite these bugs, Button City is a relaxing little game with a great storyline and characters you care about despite their faults. Players can work their way through the game at their own pace as they battle to save the arcade from greed, and Fennel from his own shy and unconfident self. The story isn’t lengthy, clocking in at 6-8 hours depending on how much time you spend playing arcade games and completing side missions, but it’s a nice little distraction for a rainy day.",
"As a portable game, Burning Skies is adequate. But as the Vita's first true FPS and a member of the Resistance family, it's a conventional, predictable disappointment. [Aug 2012, p.84]",
"Killer is Dead has a lot going for it. The foundation is there. But the positives are mired beneath a poor gameplay mechanic that makes even simple control a chore. The story isn’t allowed to shine due to simplistic writing and stereotypical characters, the difficulty can be very erratic, and too many deaths feel cheap and unfair.",
"Its strategy is just complex enough to demand some skill, and breaking down words is right up every word nerd's alley. Quarrel is flawed, but selective players who know what they want will find themselves enraptured by a siren song written in eight-letter words.",
"The Mario & Sonic series is the perfect example of the kind of charming, bite-sized, and all-inclusive entertainment that defined Nintendo throughout the Wii's golden years, but a lack of creativity and a poor implementation of the Wii U GamePad ensure that Mario & Sonic's fourth outing in six years fails to secure a podium finish.",
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 improves on the formula of FFXIII in just about every way possible. And yet, we lose a little more of what makes Final Fantasy a story-driven role-playing game. It's amazing that this happens given all the great features and gameplay elements that should've been included in FFXIII. I'm actually thinking that if you combine this sequel and its predecessor, take the strengths of each, and abandon the weaknesses, you'd finally get a 9+ game.",
"A hard, somewhat lengthy tactical RPG that gets the job done. However, it’s an older game being published by Mastiff as though it were new. And even more importantly, ""Disgaea"" came out last year and is more polished than La Pucelle.",
"Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is a good game but with a few issues. The occasional collision detection issues had me bouncing off of stuff that was at least a few feet away from me which didn’t help during boss fights, plus the boss fights themselves can get really difficult in the early going since you’re limited in how much you can upgrade until you level up a bit. Still, if you like these kinds of games it’s still worth checking out.",
"But if you're not a fan of this genre, don't be fooled by the hype – this is a solid rail shooter, but it's certainly not worth spending your money on, especially in this crowded and star-studded holiday shopping season.",
"Diablo 2 Resurrected should have been a remake. The approach might be more streamlined than most modern RPGs, and combat is just as enjoyable as it ever was. However, it's also difficult to recommend for those unwilling to push back against the game at almost every turn. If you're familiar with the original and know its quirks already, the visual refresh is enough to warrant yet another playthrough.",
"Each feature in the second installment has a purpose, a meaning, but most importantly it works as a whole. It brings a very playable combination of western and horror and is definitely worth playing even for those who are not too fond of turn-based games. [Issue#321]",
"Trek to Yomi is a missed opportunity. This game was made by real fans of Japanese cinema, who are very aware of the genre. The rudimentary gameplay however, thoroughly falls short.",
"The difficulty may turn off a lot of gamers, but if you have a bit of patience to spare or are a fan of puzzlers such like ""Super Monkey Ball,"" the game can offer many hours of gameplay.",
"If it wasn't for its few shortcomings, mainly the level design and the samey boss battles, Wolverine could have reached an even higher score. As it is, it's a well crafted game, that will surely please all time Logan's fans.",
"By the time I finished Valkyria Revolutions, I was almost comically over it. The most telling moment of the entire experience came as I was nearing the end, and my wife came downstairs and asked me, ""Ugh. Are you watching that game again? Play something more interesting!"" That's right, ""watching that game again."" With so many cutscenes, only broken up by uninspired action with ideas that don't work or aren't utilized correctly, Valkyria Revolution is tough to recommend to anyone for any reason. If the alternate history angle of the story excites you, you'd be better off playing any of the Chronicles games. If action RPG combat is your thing, Dynasty Warriors, Hyrule Warriors or the upcoming Fire Emblem Warriors should scratch that itch much better than this game can. And if you are a longtime fan of the series, like I am, I can't do anything but warn you; this is not the game you wish it was, nor expect it to be. Please, Sega, let's go back to the way it was. This Revolution is not a welcome or a successful one.",
"On its own merits, this expansion is a reasonably good deal, but it's best suited for the hard-core Disciples II fan who wishes to play every single official scenario for the game.",
"Samorost 3 is a work of art, I like to think. Right from the first challenge I fell in love with the game and I enjoyed how the world is presented. Take my word for it, some of the wacky creature designs are sure to bring a smile on your face.",
"Legendary Heroes is yet another step forward for Stardock, If you are not familiar at all with Elemental, the studio’s previous effort, or other 4X fantasy strategy games, it may even surprise you. It’s just not a stand-out game.",
"RACE On looks dated, but the quality beneath the hood can’t remain hidden for long. For a budget price you’re getting probably the most realistic racing game on pc at the moment. It may not suit the big audiences, but race fans that haven’t gotten any of these titles, will indulge themselves in the many options this game offers.",
"Although I had many visions of murdering the Moogle and will leave it to others to actually like the music, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is still a very enjoyable return to more familiar grounds. (...) It creates its own little four-dimensional microcosm full of wonders and surprises.",
"Heroes VI brings back the kind of game I thought I'd never see any more. It's rare to see a turn-based strategy game come from a major company these days, but Heroes VI goes back to the series' roots, and comes out with a great game.",
"The new classic content ultimately doesn’t soar quite high enough to justify purchase alone for F1 2012 owners but, combined with the well-honed existing content, F1 2013 is a very complete and satisfying package overall.",
"With the poor storyline, unchallenging missions, and poor enemy AI, the single player portion of the game is totally disposable. With enough patience, players could find Rogue States worthwhile, in a multiplayer capacity.",
"As winter fades away and blues skies appear, Sega Superstars Tennis will brighten up even the most miserable of days with solid gameplay, fun characters and great courts to play on.",
"Röki, like a good fairy tale, is an enchanting experience that melts the time away. Adventure gamers may find it a little less challenging than they’d prefer, but this makes the game more accessible to younger gamers without it devolving into a children’s game. It’s easy to recommend to anyone who wants to get lost in a good story set in a magical world.",
"As an Real-time tactics title, Commandos: Origins stands out as a solid entry in the genre. It carries over key elements from the original series while blending in modern mechanics and stylistic choices reminiscent of Shadow Tactics. The generous number of missions offers plenty of content, inviting players to revisit and refine their strategies. That said, persistent bugs and technical hiccups remain noticeable issues and they might just become the unpredictable factors on your road to victory.",
"Simply lacks any lasting appeal. While it may be tempting to say that long-time fans of the series may get a kick out of the game, if they’re purists they’ll likely have a problem with the gameplay tweaks added for this installment.",
"Series newbies lacking preconceived expectations will probably have the most fun with Revolution, but it’s hard to imagine fans being thrilled with the game’s at-times confused direction even if they do fully understand its proclaimed spinoff nature.",
X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a superb action game especially for fans of the character. This is the Wolverine game that fans have been waiting for. It’s not incredibly varied and a lesser game would have suffered because of this but Wolverine is just incredibly fun.,
"While there is a lot to keep track of in Age of Wonders 4, persistence pays off when it comes to the main gameplay experience. While it may take time to get used to the different gameplay concepts and menu screens, the level of variety when it comes to customisation, hero units, underground passages, and ancient wonders makes Age of Wonders 4 a paradise sandbox for strategy fans at all levels. No matter whether you’re a turn-based combat buff or more of a city management fan, you’ll be sure to find something to like in this whopper of a game.",
"EA made an excellent decision by removing Volta and introducing the Rush mode in EA Sports FC 25. This mode offers a more dynamic and solid experience that everyone will enjoy. On the other hand, the reality is that while the other improvements are promising, more is needed to claim that this is the definitive installment. This franchise urgently needs real competition to motivate further enhancements.",
"Beautiful, involving, impeccably designed and outstanding value, this is a grand game that is difficult to fault. It will captivate even those who have been immune to Final Fantasy's spell.",
"Playing The Thaumaturge is like travelling back in time to Warsaw in 1905. It captures not only the look of the city, but also the unrest of the time and the way the people of Warsaw lived. The Polish team behind the game has created a very compelling story. Although the game's mechanics have some flaws, Fool's Theory's beautiful design makes these minor flaws easy to overlook.",
"Fall of Cybertron doesn't pack the same ""Oh my god, someone finally made a good Transformers game!"" punch as its predecessor, but it's an entirely worthy successor no Optimus Prime fan should pass up.",
A solid racing title that’ll appeal to any type of gamer. The game supports the same four control schemes as Mario Kart Wii and will provide gamers with an enjoyable racing experience.,
"Playing against a real person, the strength of the pitcher-batter face-off carries the game; playing alone, you're more likely to send this one down to the minors before the end of the season.",
"It's a fact that the black and white treatment helps the game a lot. In the end, it's a nice little one-shot that works more as an atmospheric experience than a game. Especially if you're into samurai and old movies. [Issue#320]",
"Electronic Symphony doesn't rebuild the concept of Lumines block-by-block, but this Vita launch game is still the most fun I've had with the franchise since it debuted on the PSP back in 2004.",
"If you're itching for a brand new third-person shooter with some unique mechanics, then Rollerdrome may be the game for you. Its presentation, arena design, controls and combat are superb, and make up for the otherwise short length.",
"It's a better version of a game that was already quite good, now made great with extra unlockables, refined presentation, and mostly excellent online play. For fans of 3D fighters, there won't be a better title released in the genre this year.",
"Darksiders 2 gets a slightly lower score than the original, because it doesn't take much of an effort to surprise players. The gameplay mechanics are, in fact, all-too-familiar, while the narrative takes us on a relatively predictable path.",
"Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition is packed with content and should appeal to anyone who loves the Jurassic Park franchise and enjoys management-simulation games. There are presentation and interface flaws, but given the sheer amount of content on offer, fans should still check this one out.",
"Die-hard fans of the real-life motorcycle racing championships will no doubt be interested in this game just for the personalities, prototype bikes and tracks. They’re all here, but that’s where the fun ends. Overall, this is a functional but unexciting trip to the races.",
"A game that improves upon the developer's past work. But it's still a pretty lackluster shooter that doesn't perk up until the end, and it's only truly suited for people who are fiending for a Transformers game.",
"A slighty over-average game that has some good points, like its perspective and character editor, but also lacks much more game modes and fighters, something that is unforgivable in a fighting game. Although it is not a perfect game and it is even far from being very good, this is a meritable approach to MMA sports.",
"The overwhelming dryness of this style of game, along with the portability issues that hang over it like a rather nasty storm mean that this game is best left to the PC if at all possible, which is a far better platform for the amazing depth, strategy and variety that this game offers.",
"Onimusha Warlord is a classic that is easily recommended for fans of survival horror games with a samurai-related plot component. Not too reliant on its plot, the gameplay is accessible and fun, featuring some well thought out puzzles and a good environment, despite its rather short length. If anything, it makes the player want more from this delivery and hope the next one will be more ambitious.",
"Fall of Cybertron never quite transcends its franchise the way, say, Arkham City does - loving Transformers will definitely heighten your appreciation of it - but it's every bit the game that series buffs hoped for, and an improvement on its forebear.",
"Overall, Jurassic World Evolution a game that players will not enjoy if they don't like management sims and the plate-spinning and detailed fine-tuning that comes with the genre. It's a niche genre of games, but it's one that Jurassic World Evolution exemplifies well. The graphics are very good for being on a Switch port, the voice-acting is fun and adds another layer to the game, and the mechanics are largely intuitive and don't take much getting used to. Jurassic World Evolution was a well-built game when it came out in 2018, and the DLC additions and Switch port have only further proved that this is a game that fans of the franchise and management sim lovers will enjoy.",
"When Midnight Club II frustrates, you'll want to snap the disc in half and feed the pieces to the nearby watchers... But when Midnight Club II is fun, it takes you by the throat in such a manner it's impossible to stop playing.",
"One of the most original games we've seen in a long while. You play as a ghost, tasked with solving your own murder case, and in the process saving witnesses and others from the same potential fate by manipulating the enviroment in the precious few minutes before their would-be killer tries to take their life. The puzzles often border on genius and will challenge your imagination regularly. A well-thought out and well-executed puzzle game.",
"Batman: Arkham Knight may mark the end of Rocksteady’s trilogy, but it goes out with a bang. There is so much to love about it, it is easily in contention for one of the best of 2015.",
"Rollerdrome is an unbelievably fun single-player experience that hasn’t quite reached its full potential. The explosive gunplay and roller-skating trickery are complemented by the picturesque yet bleak world all realised in a graphic novel art style. However, improvements can be made with some of the enemy types, bosses, and the inclusion of other competitors. Despite room for growth, this game is clearly being made by one hell of a talented team and Rollerdrome proves to be one hell of a shooter.",
"While it's not as unique or charming as its predecessor That's You, Knowledge Is Power is a solid, fun quiz game for when you've got friends or family around. While it's a little light on actual quizzing, the Power Plays allow for plenty of game-changing moments and inject some tension into the game as everyone scrambles to wipe virtual goo off of their phones and answer first. With another solid game added to its lineup and many more coming over the next few months, Sony's PlayLink service won't be going away anytime soon.",
"With movement and combat this good it would be criminal to not see it appear more. If you love sidescrolling platformers with a healthy heaping of combat that will put your skills to the test, your next step should be buying Dead Cells.",
"Metro: Last Light can be mentioned in the same breath as big games like BioShock and Half-Life 2. Developer A4 Games proves to be very capable on a technical level, and they didn't make any concessions to the experience. When it comes to the gameplay, the developer might retain some of their (somewhat strange) own rules, but does this solely to improve the action.",
"An awesome remaster and a taste of what's to come, yet lack of new content make this package something only true fans will enjoy to the fullest. But the way this prologue plays is more than a good reason to look forward for the next installment in the series.",
"The Rabbids games have always been about silly, disposable fun, and Alive & Kicking at least delivers on two of those fronts. This installment includes the additional challenges of long load times, poor controls, and a palpable sense of déjà vu. These might not be deal-breakers for everyone, but at this point I'm ready to let the Rabbids rage by themselves.",
"Dead Cells looks like a simple old-school 2D platformer, but the core gameplay is modern and smart. The combat is fast, the gameplay style is various, and every time I start a new round would enjoy a different journey. This is a game that could easily cost you hundred of hours.",
"Shadows: Awakening ultimately fails to be the action RPG that fans of the genre need. It has some interesting ideas and decent writing, but the story shifts to the backburner after a while and the side missions and combat aren’t enough to maintain interest through the grind it turns into. It’s not bad, it’s just not particularly inspiring either. If you need a new diablo-like and a lack of polish or a glut of grind doesn’t bother you, there are definitely worse options out there.",
"There's an air of freshness about it that works in some ways and falls flat in others. Dead Kings isn't likely to reignite anyone's love for Assassin's Creed, but it certainly won't extinguish any existing flames, either.",
"And with all this fixing, adding, and rearranging, you get the sense that Dark Energy Digital desperately wants you to like their game, going as far as including an in-game ""Dev Feedback"" menu, letting players vote various aspects of the game up or down, as well as citing the reasons for those votes. But it reveals Dark Energy's focus on fixing the individual components of a fundamentally broken game, and while Prophecy's improvements make for a better experience, they only serve to make a bad experience into just another disappointment.&#8232;&#8232;",
"The PS2 version is a little less realistic than the Xbox and lacks the latter's first-person view. It also suffers from a lot of graphic pop up, while the Xbox's graphics are much more detailed. But the Xbox pays a price for these lush visuals with an iffy frame rate.",
"Mind Control Delete ultimately feels like an arcade-mode add-on that should’ve been included with the original release. Although it’s novel, I value the original’s audacity in presenting a brilliant idea without wasting any of my time. Mind Control Delete feels like the antithesis of that – it’s a bloated diversion that exists to provide more hours of gameplay without any larger purpose. It’s just more for the sake of more, and after my time with it, I’d say it’s actually too much, too late.",
"In no way would I ever recommend Hard West 2, but I have to be honest and say that I enjoyed myself. I just wish it didn’t come with a heaping bowl of curses. The developers should swallow their pride and listen intently to their customers, as I am sure I am not alone in my grievances. The team is clearly full of talented people who know how to create a good game, as long as they don’t get in their own way. As for me, I’m in need of some whiskey after this ordeal.",
"Yet another noteworthy addition to the Command and Conquer license. With enough content to entangle you into an exciting single-player campaign and a satisfying multiplayer experience, C&C 3 is a strategy game I'd advise you all to pick up.",
"There’s nothing wrong with the aesthetic of the game or its reliance on tired clichés to tell a story. It’s truly done a decent job, but that’s the crux of the problem – it’s just okay. It’s a fun title to whittle away some time with, and you may even find yourself warming up to your party members’ impenetrable plastic hearts. However, it lacks a compelling narrative, balance, and combat variety necessary to make it as engaging as it should be.",
"I really enjoy Throne and Liberty’s colorful world, detailed environments, and engaging combat. Though the story is pretty uninspired, the game is technically polished and that alone is worthy of praise. But as a primarily solo player, the game isn’t for me in the long run. That’s not really a criticism, because being built for groups isn’t a bug, it’s a feature. That was true back at the dawn of MMORPGs and sometimes it’s still true. I think Throne and Liberty has a lot of promise to succeed at launch and grow beyond it.",
"With tons of references and entertaining gameplay, Portal Portal is a great new table. It’s a little thin on content and will require the purchase of either Zen Pinball 2 or Pinball FX2 to play it, however, so it’s an investment that those coming only for the Portal aspect might need to rationalize.",
"What is Samorost 3? It's more of an exploration game full of child-like wonder than a classic point'n'click adventure. It's a unique audiovisual experience, a pretty little indie gem that has more in common with real art than many modern art installations in various museums.",
"Solid visuals and audio, old-school charm and an absolutely huge adventure to slog through are not enough to offset the fact that this a brutally difficult game at the outset and it does nothing to help you along while you learn the ropes.",
"Morteshka’s deal with the devil has paid off, as Black Book delivers a captivating story and engaging gameplay full of strategy and variety that should keep you busy for over 40 hours. Being in league with Satan usually comes with a great price, but players should be able to overcome any curses handed down to them. With strong character development and narrative, this wicked book is a page-turner that’s worth a read.",
"Sure, the game does hold its fair share of problems - average graphics, an unoriginal story, a tendency to become monotonous and the occasional cheesy comment or two, but there&#146;s enough solid content in the game to keep both old and new Pitfall fans happy.",
"Sudoku Gridmaster is, in a way, both the best and the worst sudoku videogame on the market. It provides the best straightforward, “I just want to play” game of sudoku out there, but at the same time, it’s severely lacking in the options department.",
"How To Train Your Dragon on consoles seems to suffer from a bit of an identity crisis. It wants to dabble in everything, while managing to avoid executing anything particularly well.",
"Relic has spent four years honing a distracting interface, revitalising a less-than-perfect control system and, above all, recreating anew the sense of majesty and scale that originally distinguished this deep-space strategy title. [Nov 2003, p.103]",
"Concord is a decent shooter with rock-solid mechanics and AAA visuals, but that’s not enough to attract an audience to yet another live-service game. As is, it’s a fine release, albeit one that feels like it was pumped out of a boardroom algorithm. If you’ve got $40 to spare and aren’t hung up by comparisons to similar shooters (like the free-to-play Destiny 2, Valorant, and the upcoming Marvel Rivals), Concord is a fun time, flaws and all.",
If you just pretend the egregious FPS story mode doesn't exist there is a good amount of enjoyable content here and for those that have enjoyed previous Time Crisis games this is an obvious choice.,
"Lock's Quest is certainly one of the better DS games to hit the platform this year. If you're a fan of past DS strategy titles - LostMagic or Revenant Wings, for example - picking up Lock's Quest is a no-brainer.",
"In a nutshell, Mega Man Star Force is an okay game, but it's just too much like the Battle Network games to really warrant a purchase. The story is all over the place, the graphics and sound look virtually unchanged, and the attempt at making a new battle system just seems a bit lazy.",
"For fans or even gamers just interested in action hack n' slash games a like, you can't do wrong to invest some time in Wolverine's latest gaming outing, for the most part it offers up a visceral ride of gory action.",
Dead Cells is a candidate for the best indie game of 2018. It does everything right: it's a well-made mix of genres that has personality and is capable of entertaining us for hours.,
"Packed full of the charm and character that you'd expect from the series, Persona 4 Dancing All Night is a thoroughly entertaining rhythm game that could warm even the coldest heart.",
"The visuals are charming, the sound is muteable, and figuring out how to efficiently use your controlled arsenal is great, but for a game that's all about logically thinking out plans, we could have done without the unpredictability.",
"They've brought in most of the standard instruments found in rock bands, they've blurred the lines between gaming and learning with Pro mode and they've created a fantastic party game, which is even better with a new instrument and vocal harmonies.",
"It is a fun and accessible game even to those who have never pondered the gender, the tools for creating and sharing levels, and even campaigns, as well as multiplayer modes add a special touch and SEED Studios should be congratulated for their work. It offers one of the proposals with the highest return on the entire catalog of service.",
Box Boy! is a game that reminds us of the golden age of the Game Boy. Its level and gameplay design really shine and remind us the reasons why Nintendo became a leader in this market at various stages of its history.,
"Ridger Racer is back and manages to impress with some great gameplay and a brilliant soundtrack. The City Creator is bigger then ever, yet is only at its best when you've finished the game. The tons of new possibilities are great but they make the game a bit cluttered, giving you the feeling that you aren't accomplishing much. The multiplayer has also been expanded and will keep you entertained for many hours to come.",
"Splatoon 3: Side Order is a very fun and challenging expansion, with a great level of replayability and a level design that makes it very addictive. While it can get a bit repetitive in the long run, it is original enough to be a great end to the single-player content of this game.",
"Although the gameplay is confusing and disorientating, the game as a whole is a nice package. It has great presenation with a simple, straightfoward interface, and the overall atmosphere gives off a nice world domination feeling.",
"Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a beautiful history lesson about a genre-defining game, which would've been a whole lot better if the AI had reached is definitive form as well. The new aesthetic makes it easy to ignore the obsolete, underlying technology for a few campaigns, but it would really be a feat to stay entertained for all 10 of them.",
"I would have liked to see them throw in some more RPG style elements to the game, make the intensity of the spells come in varying levels as the character progresses, but as is, it's fairly inconceivable to imagine someone playing this one through several times.",
"The new installment introduces a lot of changes, but does not depart from the atmosphere of the previous entries to the series. It’s an excellent turn-based strategy that offers not only an engaging campaign, but also graphics unmatched across the genre. The only thing Age of Wonders 4 needs, are improvements to the multiplayer, as right now it doesn't work great.",
"As a standalone title, or if it's your first NFS, it's not bad, but it's not the kick-start the series needed. If you're looking for a game to kick back and play race after race, Unbound has enough content to keep you glued to the screen.",
"A throwback to the way RPGs used to be made before polygons. With anime-style characters and a firm story and gameplay, this game should be enjoyable for anyone who can get past the graphical weaknesses.",
"It's got a lot of style, some depth and a lot of humor to it as you can see by the monsters and the characters themselves, but it's not a graphical or aural powerhouse, which might not appeal to everyone.",
"The Metronomicon is bright and upbeat fusion of two genres that shouldn’t fit together as well as they do. There’s a great sense of humor running through the entire game from the character and monster designs, background details, and even item descriptions, and the audio holds up its end with an energetic soundtrack holding a large number of tunes that are fun to tap out attacks to.",
"There are neat ideas at work, but ultimately, the premise and structure of You're In The Movies is a little too thin to recommend. If you're going to be getting a rowdy group together, and you're patient enough to get the camera working, it can make for a fun evening or two. But the thrills don't last.",
"I love this game, but I've eaten enough snow to have some gripes. It's too difficult to catch rails—miscalculate ever so slightly, and you'll wipe out hard, killing any combo and losing tons of turbo.",
"I'm stunned by just how much fun Fall of Cybertron is. This isn't a game that will redefine the genre or anything else hyperbolic in nature. What it is, however, is a tremendous amount of fun.",
"Dungeons 4 is a complete package that delivers a way to embrace your dark side, build your very own evil empire, and see the forces of good reduced to dust. It heavily focuses on resource management more than strategic combat, which may be off-putting to some, but there’s a lot of challenge here, and combat is equally as satisfying. Just watch out for the unicorns. They’re more fierce than you’d think.",
"Despite having many good elements, such as the amazing story or the great characters, the game tries to be different from Valkyria Chronicles while being too faithful to it. Therefore, the result is gameplay that lacks personality and doesn't really know what it wants to be.",
"The lore of Diablo is as interesting as it ever was even if the storytelling isn’t nearly as fleshed out as one would see in modern games. Giving a facelift to a twenty-year-old game without updating the gameplay is a gamble, but thankfully that is exactly what we got with Diablo II: Resurrected which is how the original fans would want it.",
"Simple, clean, straightforward and bland, Neopets is a baked potato without fixings, a bed without blankets, a cake without frosting, or a chair without cushions... It's a minimalist's action adventure.",
"The single-player missions don't take long to beat and the game's multiplayer lacks depth. Armored Core 4 should keep robot lovers busy, but it failed to improve nearly as much as expected.",
"Tropico 3 is an enjoyable city simulator that offers the same sort of replayability that others of its kind do; this one just emphasizes experimentation with moral behavior rather than perfecting a building grid. Outside of the refined graphics and Latin soundtrack, it doesn't reach too far beyond the original Tropico. But that's fine with me, as it was the best of its kind since the original SimCity.",
"As usual, Multiplayer is where it&#146;s at. There&#146;s just too much good stuff balled up into one package here not to have two or more humans at the helm, bashing their heads against one another in an RTS royale cage match.",
"Incorporating elements from a number of other titles, this highly polished and incredibly playable title has taken the bar and kicked it up a notch, and is definitely one of the best platformers currently available.",
"Unequivocally better than the original in almost every single way, XIII-2 presents a rehabilitated spin on one of the most polarizing Square-Enix releases in recent years, as well as a promising way forward for the franchise. It may not be enough to undo what's already been done, but for what it's worth, XIII-2 may just change your mind about the future.",
"Instead of treading in familiar action territory, Castlevania Judgement introduces us to a fighting genre with Castlevania characters but the overall Castlevania feel and quality that the series usually displays suffers quite a bit with this change.",
This is not the type of game that you'll want to play the heck out of for a week straight. It's best enjoyed in short bursts when you're in the mood for a little bit of frenzied shooter action.,
"AI flaws and a manual that takes rather a lot for granted make getting started a bit tedious, but when you do it's a great simulation that offers a whole lot more than the standard flight sim and a massive challenge to boot.",
"The real strength of Ridge Racer Unbounded is its Track Editor. Gameplay, options and cars are inspired by other racing brands, without bringing anything new to the arcade racing genre.",
"Darksiders II is full of enormous environments and dungeons to traverse to and explore, even more fantastical enemies and large-scale bosses to battle, and plenty of challenging hacking, slashing and loot collecting.",
"""Ghost Recon"" was not a bad game but what Red Storm have done this time around is definitely more action packed and the online play really tops it all off to make Ghost Recon 2 one of the best tactical shooters of the year, if not the best.",
This game appears to be suited for the younger audience but not too young as some of the evil characters are freaky with their weird screams and looks they may scare the little ones.,
"It’s pretty hard to mess up Puzzle Bobble, and thankfully that hasn’t happened here. It’s also rather difficult to add to it, however, and I think the fact that Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! has managed to do so fairly well is to its credit. For puzzle fans it’s an easy pick-up, built around a time-honored core concept and loaded with things to do. Those who like to play games with their family will also want to give this a look as it’s a surprisingly good party game, too.",
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a great remake of a good game. The visual overhaul of the graphics looks great and the new QoL features help iron out some of the rough edges that are present in many games of its era. The sameness of the stages and the short runtime are blows against the game, but it's still a fun experience, and worth checking out for fans of platformers.",
"EA Sports FC 25 makes smart choices so that the time you're spending in the game feels much more worthwhile. Rush is the best addition in years, and hopefully indicative of the future of the franchise.",
"Despite a couple of blemishes, The FRAMED Collection is a clever and stylish addition to the Switch library. Inevitably, it’s much smoother to play with touch controls, but it’s worth seeing the bold characters and more vibrant set pieces play out on a big TV. A couple of iffy puzzles and a fairly short run time for both games shouldn’t put you off too much, as there are some excellent ideas here and a refreshingly cool overall experience.",
"If you absolutely must have a Sudoku game for your Nintendo DS, I'd recommend buying a copy of ""Brain Age,"" even if it only contains one hundred puzzles. Sudoku Gridmaster is a decent game, but its problems outweigh any positives it offers.",
"Episode 3 of Telltale's Batman: The Enemy Within is well thought out and strongly written. Telltale has weaved together a complicated web of relationships that's becoming strained by the people tangled in it. After two relatively straightforward episodes, this is exactly what the series needed to carry it forward and ensure players are compelled to see it through.",
"An excellent RTS game. Even though the gameplay is still relatively the same, that doesn't mean you shouldn't miss out on the story, exciting action, and ultimately the overall fun experience from the entire game.",
Fairly easy controls that actually respond differently between the different corvette models AND when upgrades are done on the cars. An easy to use setup that racing fans will feel very familiar with.,
"Legrand Legacy: Tale of the Fatebounds is an enjoyable JRPG which brings back features that are difficult to find in modern games, such as a turn-based combat system enriched by action and tactical elements, mini-games and more. Sadly, SEMISOFT didn't bring anything truly new to the table and, as such, fails in being more than just a well-crafted tribute to the golden era of JRPGs.",
"This is definitely one hell of a weird experience. The art style is magnificent, the combat exhilarating and the soundtrack interesting. Interesting is also an apt word to describe the humor in the game. However, the level design is rather repetitive and the much advertised 'gigolo' missions are rather limited in options. If you liked similar titles like No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw, you might just like Killer is Dead, if you're willing to overlook its flaws.",
There's plenty of potential in the Officers franchise. Few games manage to capture WW2 this well at the tactical level. But a few problems with friendly AI and stability do drag the score down somewhat.,
"This departure from the franchise is an invigorating reboot that should satisfy both racing enthusiasts and action junkies alike while the decidedly robust track creation system should have the community upping the ante for months to come. Frag, destroy, create and decimate - it's all on the cards in Ridge Racer Unbounded.",
"It's not a classic game, but Fullmetal Alchemist 2 ably performs both of its intended functions: it's fun for existing series fans, and a decent enough game that those who haven't had contact with the original property will get far enough that the concept could intrigue them.",
"Although Myths of the Eastern is a very attractive idea because there are not many videogames that delve into Chinese mythology, the DLC is poorly executed and feels like a skin placed on Immortals Fenyx Rising. The story is interesting at times, but there are no adjustments to the game mechanics nor added value to the overall experience.",
"While this is definitely a solid improvement on its dreadful predecessor, it needed to achieve a basic level of competence and build upon it, and it only does that to a very limited extent.",
"Overall, NBA 2K23 is a fitting tribute to the historical legends and iconic moments that made this sport what it is today. Though the game has its fair share of issues with its poor narrative choices and omnipresent microtransactions, it’s still a solid improvement over the previous game. This year’s release isn’t quite the flashy free-throw line dunk that lands a perfect score, but it is a worthy, all-around effort that would earn M.J.’s shrug of approval.",
"Pikuniku is a hilarious game that’s oozing with charm. Its single player campaign is full of moments that make you feel like a kid again, and its co-op mode is surprisingly relaxing. Unfortunately its charm is let down by a clumsy control scheme that doesn’t always mesh with some of the mechanics, and this can create an experience that ultimately feels unrewarding.",
"When we throw all the listed elements into a pot and mix them, we get an excellent playable basketball, which is great to watch and you will enjoy every single virtual game. But we already feel the stagnation in the series and the technical shortcomings do not help either.",
"An exhilarating experience that beats home just what kind of masters Platinum Games are at what they do. One of the best action games in years, and one that will stay with you for a very long time.",
"The beginnings were extremely promising but 8 hours later (around the middle of the campaign) I was seriously tired and annoyed by a myriad of small nuisances which successfully strip the whole experience of joy. [02/2019, p.64]",
"The Great Escape is saved by a few good set-pieces and the licence, but it's hard not to feel hard done by. Those willing to endure yet another stealth game could find their morale ebbing away by the end of this. [Sept 2003]",
"Revita has a lot going for it. Part roguelike, part shooter, part platformer, it has something for just about everyone. Throw in a melancholic story and addictive gameplay, and you’re in for an enjoyable time.",
"It's a solid and enjoyable action title with enough action and plot to keep you interested over the long haul. Even if you don't like the comics or care about the upcoming movie, there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours.",
"B.I.O.T.A. is an old school metroidvania heavily inspired by James Cameron’s “Aliens”. It is not groundbreaking, but the gameplay is really varied and the art style will surely appeal to retro games maniacs. However, despite its retro look B.I.O.T.A. is very forgiving, which might not be an advantage to everyone – personally, I wish it was more challenging.",
"What .hack//G.U. throws at you is a brisk (well, compared to most jRPGs), well planned, somewhat clever but ultimately a bit generic romp through a MMORPG that resides in a unsettling futuristic world that you only view through electronic windows.",
"It's the kind of game that a family can enjoy together, and perhaps is best in that sense. Ironic gen-Xers and urban wiggers probably won't get much from it, but then that's why games like Need For Speed and GTA exist. [PC Zone]",
"The Waylanders is to be commended for the way it takes Celtic mythology and extracts cool moments and conflicts. It’s a great jumping-off point to learn more about the Tuatha De Danann and the stories of pre-Christianity Ireland. It also tries to innovate party-driven RPG combat by focusing on formations and their advantages. Unfortunately, engaging with the game world and its mechanics is not fun enough. Most combat encounters feel interchangeable, companions do not have much personality, there’s a lot of walking around. Working the camera never feels good, especially in tight quarters during battles. The Waylanders also needs major tweaks to its difficulty if it wants to attract more than a very niche audience.",
"While I can honestly say that I'm not a big racing fan, Suzuki TT Superbikes was able to appeal to the competitor in me by providing a very accessible game for novices with enough depth to keep veterans challenged for many, many races.",
"Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a bargain title with a unique twist to the third-person run & gun. It remains to be seen if ""swim & gun"" games will make a splash in the industry, but this one is worth a look.",
"A thoroughly engaging racing game with high production value and an extensive amount of replay. From the multiple game modes, to the extensive customization options to finally the numerous online options, there is an incredible amount of game to enjoy.",
"There are still some stupid mistakes here -- like the lack of a quick save hotkey or the absence of a restart option when you fail a mission -- but all in all, this is an excellent and challenging title that's not content to reproduce what everyone else has already done.",
"Hunt the Night is a beautiful game that crafts a haunting atmosphere and an engrossing world. Despite some uneven design, the desire to unravel Medhram’s mysteries and see the next inventive boss fight kept me engaged until the end of the 15-hour adventure. If you can stomach the frustrating combat elements, there is a lot to enjoy in Vesper’s quest.",
"For the past two decades, Puzzle Bobble (aka Bust-A-Move) has been coasting off the momentum of the first four mainline games. Everybubble’s abundant stages, flawless performance, and incorporation of different play modes don’t revolutionize the franchise but delivers a package that’s as well-rounded as a soap bubble.",
"The Metronomicon is a game for those who want their rhythm games to be a little different. Though the story is inconsequential, the various RPG elements spice up an otherwise nice twist on the standard rhythm game formula. The different modes give the game some legs, while the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. Despite a few flaws here and there, The Metronomicon is certainly recommended for rhythm fans.",
"Its surprisingly deep and satisfyingly weighty combat engine combined with three strong and varied player characters and a host of cleverly-designed enemies elevate it above the usual button-mashing experience perhaps expected of entries in this genre. It’s got an excellent arcade mode that branches off in various directions as you make your way to the final boss battle, as well as a ton of unlockable modes and extras to keep you coming back for more. Whether you’re a learned fan of old-school beat’em ups or you just like pummelling the life out of mutant punk pussycats and monkeys dressed as Bruce Lee, you owe it to yourself to experience what Sebastian Garcia has created here; it’s easily one of the best beat’em ups we’ve played.",
"Root Double: Before Crime * After Days is an engaging science fiction visual novel that I’d consider a must-play title in the genre, and the Switch version has become one of the best ways to experience it. Small systems hold it back from being better, such as confusing gameplay, suspension of disbelief breaking, and exposition dumping. Still, with its compelling narrative beats, engaging writing, and creative concepts, you’ll find it difficult to put this one down.",
"NBA 2K23 is worth the price of admission almost entirely because of how good the new MyNBA Eras mode is. What makes NBA 2K23 the best installment in years is the well-needed gameplay changes, as well as the return of the enthralling Jordan Challenge mode. Sadly, 2K keeps much of the fun locked behind an expensive paywall that simply cannot be justified.",
"The controls are very simple and there is a variety of different ways to get things done in this game. The object is to find the most effective way to do it, so you do not waste too much time and energy playing one level.",
